Note, the fillowing files are part of the cspice toolkit, but were not submitted to source control.

brief.exe
chronos.exe
ckbrief.exe
commnt.exe
dskbrief.exe
dskexp.exe
frmdiff.exe
inspekt.exe
mkdsk.exe
mkspk.exe
msopck.exe
simple.exe
spacit.exe
spkdiff.exe
spkmerge.exe
states.exe
subpt.exe
tictoc.exe
tobin.exe
toxfr.exe
version.exe

It is perfectly fine to unpack the original toolkit files to this location.
