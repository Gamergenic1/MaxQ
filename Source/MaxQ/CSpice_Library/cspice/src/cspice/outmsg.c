/*     LIST           is a list of error message types.  A list is a */
/*                    character string containing one or more words */
/*                    from the following list, separated by commas. */

/*                       DEFAULT */

/*                    Each type of error message specified in LIST will */
/*                    be output when an error is detected, if it is */
/*                    enabled for output.  Note that DEFAULT does */
/*                    NOT refer to the "default message selection," */
/*                    but rather to a special message that is output */
/*                    when the error action is 'DEFAULT'.  This message */
/*                    is a statement referring the user to the error */
/*                    handling documentation. */

/*                    Messages are never duplicated in the output; for */
/*                    instance, supplying a value of LIST such as */

/*                       'SHORT, SHORT' */

/*                    does NOT result in the output of two short */
/*                    messages. */

/*                    The words in LIST may appear in mixed case; */
/*                    for example, the call */

/*                       CALL OUTMSG ( 'ShOrT' ) */

/*                    will work. */

/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*     None. */

/* $ Parameters */

/*     FILEN          is the maximum device name length that can be */
/*                    accommodated by this routine. */

/*     NAMELN         is the maximum length of an individual module name. */

/*     LL             is the maximum line length for the output message. */
/*                    If the output message string is very long, it is */
/*                    displayed over several lines, each of which has a */
/*                    maximum length of LL characters. */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*     1)  This routine detects invalid message types in the argument, */
/*         LIST.   The short error message in this case is */
/*         'SPICE(INVALIDLISTITEM)' */

/* $ Files */

/*      None. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*      This routine is part of the SPICELIB error handling */
/*      mechanism. */

/*      This routine outputs the error messages specified in LIST that */
/*      have been enabled for output (use the SPICELIB routine ERRPRT */
/*      to enable or disable output of specified types of error */
/*      messages).  A border is written out preceding and following the */
/*      messages.  Output is directed to the current error output device. */

/* $ Examples */

/*      1)  Output the short and long error messages: */

/*         C */
/*         C     Output short and long messages: */
/*         C */
/*               CALL OUTMSG ( 'SHORT, LONG' ) */

/* $ Restrictions */

/*      1)  This routine is intended for use by the SPICELIB error */
/*          handling mechanism.  SPICELIB users are not expected to */
/*          need to call this routine. */

/*         bounds differently than in previous versions, and no longer */
/*         handles all possible inputs as required by this routine. */
/*         LJUST, which is used now, is error free. */

/*         caused a line break one character too soon.  A minor bug, but */
