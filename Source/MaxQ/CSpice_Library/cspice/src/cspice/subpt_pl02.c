-Procedure subpt_pl02 ( Sub-observer point using DSK type 2 plate model )
 
-Abstract
 
   Deprecated: This routine has been superseded by the CSPICE routine
   subpnt_c. This routine is supported for purposes of backward
   compatibility only.

   Compute the rectangular coordinates of the sub-observer point on a
   target body at a particular epoch, optionally corrected for light
   time and stellar aberration.  The target body's surface is
   represented by a triangular plate model contained in a type 2 DSK
   segment. Return the sub-observer point's coordinates expressed in the
   body-fixed frame associated with the target body.  Also, return the
   observer's altitude above the target body.

-Detailed_Input
 
   handle      is the DAS file handle of a DSK file open for read
               access.  This kernel must contain a type 2 segment
               that provides a plate model representing the entire
               surface of the target body.


   dladsc      is the DLA descriptor of a DSK segment representing
               the surface of the target body.


   method      is a short string specifying the computation method
               to be used.  The choices are:
 
                  "Intercept"        The sub-observer point is defined
                                     as the plate model surface
                                     intercept of the ray starting at
                                     the observer and passing through
                                     the target's center.

                  "Ellipsoid 
                   near point"       The sub-observer point is defined
                                     as the plate model surface
                                     intercept of the ray starting at
                                     the observer and passing through
                                     the nearest point to the observer
                                     on a reference ellipsoid
                                     associated with the target body.

                                     This option requires that the
                                     reference ellipsoid's radii be
                                     available in the kernel pool.
 
               For both computation methods, this routine finds a
               sub-point on the same side of the target body as the
               observer.  If the observer is inside the target body,
               the "sub-point" will actually be above the observer.
               In the case of multiple intercepts, the outermost one
               (that is, the one farthest from the target center) is
               selected.

               Neither case nor white space are significant in the
               string "method".  For example, the string 
           
                  "  ellipsoidNEARPOINT"

               is valid.
 
 
   target      is the name of the target body.  `target' is
               case-insensitive, and leading and trailing blanks in
               `target' are not significant. Optionally, you may supply
               a string containing the integer ID code for the object.
               For example both "MOON" and "301" are legitimate strings
               that indicate the moon is the target body.
 
               This routine assumes that the target body's surface is
               represented by a plate model, and that a DSK file
               containing the plate model has been loaded via dasopr_c.
 

   et          is the epoch, represented  as seconds past J2000 TDB, at
               which the sub-observer point on the target body is to be
               computed.  When aberration corrections are used, `et'
               refers to the epoch at which radiation is received at
               the observer.
 
 
   abcorr      indicates the aberration corrections to be applied to
               the position and orientation of the target body to
               account for one-way light time and stellar aberration.
               See the discussion in the Particulars section for
               recommendations on how to choose aberration corrections.
                 
               `abcorr' may be any of the following: 
 
                  "NONE"     Apply no correction. Use the geometric
                             position of the target body relative to
                             the observer; evaluate the target body's
                             orientation at `et'.
 
               The following values of `abcorr' apply to the
               "reception" case in which photons depart from the
               target's location at the light-time corrected epoch
               et-lt and *arrive* at the observer's location at
               `et':
 
                  "LT"       Correct for one-way light time (also
                             called "planetary aberration") using a
                             Newtonian formulation. This correction
                             uses the position and orientation of the
                             target at the moment it emitted photons
                             arriving at the observer at `et'.
 
                             The light time correction uses an
                             iterative solution of the light time 
                             equation (see Particulars for details). 
                             The solution invoked by the "LT" option 
                             uses one iteration. 
 
                  "LT+S"     Correct for one-way light time and stellar
                             aberration using a Newtonian formulation.
                             This option modifies the position obtained
                             with the "LT" option to account for the
                             observer's velocity relative to the solar
                             system barycenter. The result is the
                             sub-observer point computed using the
                             apparent position and orientation of the
                             target as seen by the observer.
 
                  "CN"       Converged Newtonian light time 
                             correction.  In solving the light time 
                             equation, the "CN" correction iterates 
                             until the solution converges (three 
                             iterations on all supported platforms). 
 
                             The "CN" correction typically does not 
                             substantially improve accuracy because 
                             the errors made by ignoring 
                             relativistic effects may be larger than 
                             the improvement afforded by obtaining 
                             convergence of the light time solution. 
                             The "CN" correction computation also  
                             requires a significantly greater number 
                             of CPU cycles than does the  
                             one-iteration light time correction. 
 
                  "CN+S"     Converged Newtonian light time 
                             and stellar aberration corrections. 


   obsrvr      is the name of the observing body.  This is typically a
               spacecraft, the earth, or a surface point on the earth.
               `obsrvr' is case-insensitive, and leading and trailing
               blanks in `obsrvr' are not significant. Optionally, you
               may supply a string containing the integer ID code for
               the object.  For example both "EARTH" and "399" are
               legitimate strings that indicate the earth is the
               observer.
 
-Detailed_Output

   spoint      is the sub-observer point on the target body expressed
               relative to the body-fixed reference frame of the target
               body.
 
               The definition of sub-observer point depends on the
               selected computation method.  See the description of the
               input argument `method' for details.
 
               The target body-fixed frame, which is time-dependent, is
               evaluated at `et' if `abcorr' is "NONE"; otherwise the
               frame is evaluated at et-lt, where `lt' is the one-way
               light time from target to observer.
 
               The position and orientation of the target body are
               corrected for aberration as specified by `abcorr'; the
               corrected position and orientation are used in the
               computation of `spoint'.
 

   alt         is the signed distance between the observer and the
               sub-point.  When the observer is outside the body
               `alt' is positive; when the observer is inside, `alt'         
               is negative.

               Note that `alt' is not truly an `altitude' unless the
               observer-to-sub-point vector happens to be perpendicular
               to the target body's surface at the sub-point.  In
               general this condition should not be expected to hold,
               unless the plate model representation of the target
               body's surface very nearly matches the target body's
               reference ellipsoid and the "ellipsoid near point"
               computation method is selected.
               
           
 
   plateID     is the integer ID code of the plate on which the 
               sub-observer point is located.  This ID code can be
               use to look up data associated with the plate, such
               as the plate's vertices or outward normal vector.

       will be signaled.

-Files
 
   Appropriate DSK, SPK, PCK, and frame data must be available to
   the calling program before this routine is called.  Typically
   the data are made available by loading kernels; however the
   data may be supplied via subroutine interfaces if applicable.
 
   The following data are required:
 
      - DSK data:  a DSK file containing a plate model representing the
        target body's surface must be loaded. This kernel must contain
        a type 2 segment that contains data for the entire surface of
        the target body.

      - SPK data:  ephemeris data for target and observer must be
        loaded.  If aberration corrections are used, the states of
        target and observer relative to the solar system barycenter
        must be calculable from the available ephemeris data.
        Typically ephemeris data are made available by loading one
        or more SPK files via furnsh_c.
 
      - PCK data:  triaxial radii for the target body must be loaded
        into the kernel pool if the "Ellipsoid Near Point" method is
        selected. Typically these data are made available by loading a
        text PCK file via furnsh_c.
 
      - Further PCK data:  rotation data for the target body must
        be loaded.  These may be provided in a text or binary PCK file.
        Either type of file may be loaded via furnsh_c.

      - Frame data:  if a frame definition is required to convert
        the observer and target states to the body-fixed frame of
        the target, that definition must be available in the kernel
        pool.  Typically the definition is supplied by loading a
        frame kernel via furnsh_c.
 
   In all cases, kernel data are normally loaded once per program
   run, NOT every time this routine is called.
 
-Particulars
 
   subpt_pl02 computes the sub-observer point (abbreviated as
   "sub-point") on a target body. subpt_pl02 also determines the
   distance from the observer to the sub-observer point.

   Sub-point Definitions
   =====================
 
   This routine offers two ways of defining the sub-point:

      - The "intercept" method. In general, this definition
        calls for defining a ray emanating from the observer and
        passing through the center of the target body.  The intercept
        on the first plate (the one closest to the observer) hit by this
        ray is the sub-point.
  
        The details of this definition are a bit more complex, because
        this routine handles the case where the observer is inside the
        target.  In such cases, the sub-point is actually the point
        that would be obtained by scaling up the target center-
        observer vector so as to place the observer outside the target,
        then computing the sub-point in the usual way.  This handling
        of the interior observer case prevents an observer location
        that is slightly below the surface from accidentally being
        associated with a sub-point on the opposite side of the target.
        However, the possibility that the "sub-point" may be "above"
        the observer may seem counterintuitive.
         
      - The "ellipsoid near point" method.  When a target's surface is 
        modeled by a set of triangular plates, the notion of "dropping
        a perpendicular segment to the surface," which makes sense
        for convex surfaces, becomes problematic:  there need not be
        any plate whose normal vector is parallel to a segment from
        the observer to some point on that plate, or there could be
        more than one such plate.  If such a plate exists, it might
        be located anywhere on the visible surface---not necessarily
        "below" the observer.

        To work around these problems, the ellipsoid near point method
        uses a reference ellipsoid to define a preliminary sub-point:
        for an exterior observer, this is the unique point on the
        ellipsoid's surface at which the outward surface normal points
        toward the observer.  Then the plate model sub-point is defined
        as the plate intercept closest to the observer of a ray
        emanating from the observer and passing through the preliminary
        sub-point on the ellipsoid.

   For a large target such as Mars, or for any target whose reference
   ellipsoid deviates significantly from spherical, the results
   obtained using the two sub-point definitions can be quite different.
   The example program provided below demonstrates this fact; Phobos is
   the target body in this case.  Some analysis on the user's part will
   be needed to select the "best" definition for a given application.
 
   When comparing sub-point computations with results from sources
   other than SPICE, it's essential to make sure the same geometric
   definitions are used.


   Aberration Corrections
   ======================

   Below, we indicate the aberration corrections to use for some 
   common applications: 
 
      1) Compute the sub-observer point using the apparent direction
         and orientation of a target. This is the most common case for
         a remote-sensing observation.  When the observer's altitude
         is more than one target radius above the surface:
 
            Use "LT+S":  apply both light time and stellar  
            aberration corrections. 

         Note that when the observer is close to the target surface,
         this choice may yield inaccurate results, since light time is
         measured between the observer and the target center.  When the
         observer has altitude of less than one target radius above the
         surface, aberration corrections should be omitted, so in this
         case abcorr should be set to:

            "NONE"          

      2) Use a geometric position vector and uncorrected target
         orientation as low-accuracy estimates for an application where
         execution speed is critical.
 
            Use "NONE". 
 
   See the header of the CSPICE routine spkezr_c for a detailed
   discussion of aberration corrections.
 
-Examples
 
   The numerical results shown for this example may differ across
   platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input,
   the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine specific
   arithmetic implementation.
 
   In the following example program, the file

      phobos.3.3.dsk

   is a DSK file containing a type 2 segment that provides a plate model 
   representation of the surface of Phobos.  The file
 
      mar085.bsp
 
   is a binary SPK file containing data for Phobos, the Earth, and the
   Sun for a time interval bracketing the date
    
      2006 NOV 3 00:00:00 UTC.
 
   pck00009.tpc is a planetary constants kernel file containing radii
   and rotation model constants.  naif0009.tls is a leapseconds kernel.
 
   All of the kernels other than the DSK file should be loaded via
   a meta-kernel.  An example of the contents of such a kernel is:

       \begindata

          KERNELS_TO_LOAD = ( 'naif0009.tls'
                              'pck00009.tpc'
                              'mar085.bsp' )
       \begintext


   Find the sub-observer point of the Earth on Phobos for a specified
   sequence of times. Perform the computation twice, using both the
   "intercept" and "ellipsoid near point" options. Compute the
   corresponding near point values using an ellipsoidal surface for
   comparison.

-Version
 
   -CSPICE Version 2.0.0, 23-JUL-2016 (NJB) 
 
       Bug fix: the DSK segment's surface ID code is no longer
       required to match that of the target. The segment's
       center ID must match.

       Added failed_c calls.

       Include file references have been updated. Now calls zzdsksgr_
       instead of dsksgr_. Updated integer output format in example
       program.

   -Beta Version 1.3.0, 30-APR-2014 (NJB) (BVS)

       Adding missing "return" statement after chkout_c call
       in branch for bad input method string.

       Now includes dsk_proto.h.

       Last update was 07-APR-2014 (BVS)

       Changed FRAME to FRAMES in the Required_Reading section.

   -Beta Version 1.2.0, 14-MAY-2010 (NJB)

       Updated for compatibility with new DSK design.

   -Beta Version 1.1.0, 09-FEB-2007 (NJB)

       Bug fix:  type of local variable fDLADescr was changed to SpiceInt.

   -Beta Version 1.0.0, 06-NOV-2006 (NJB)
