/*     HANDLE     I   File handle. */
/*     SEGNO      I   Segment number. */
/*     SEGDSC     O   Segment descriptor. */

/* $ Detailed_Input */

/*     HANDLE         is a file handle of an EK open for read or write */
/*                    access. */

/*     SEGNO          is the number of a segment whose descriptor is */
/*                    desired.  A segment number is simply the ordinal */
/*                    position of the segment in its parent EK. */

/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*     SEGDSC         is the descriptor of the specified segment. */

/* $ Parameters */

/*     None. */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*     1)  If HANDLE is invalid, the error will be diagnosed by routines */
/*         called by this routine. */

/*     2)  If SEGNO is invalid, the error will be diagnosed by routines */
/*         called by this routine. */

/*     3)  If an I/O error occurs while reading the indicated file, */
/*         the error will be diagnosed by routines called by this */
/*         routine. */

/* $ Files */

/*     See the EK Required Reading for a discussion of the EK file */
/*     format. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     This routine centralizes the coded needed to look up the */
