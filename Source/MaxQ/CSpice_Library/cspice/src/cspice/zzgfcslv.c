/* $ Particulars */

/*     This routine handles coordinate search set-up and execution */
/*     activities for GFEVNT. */

/*     For a surface intercept coordinate search, this routine finds the */
/*     "existence window," within the input confinement window, for the */
/*     surface intercept and its time derivative. The existence window */
/*     is contracted by CNTRCT seconds; this contracted window is then */
/*     used as the confinement window for the search. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     See GFEVNT and ZZGFLONG. */

/* $ Restrictions */

/*     1)  The interface and functionality of this set of routines may */
/*         change without notice.  These routines should be called only */
/*         by SPICELIB routines. */

/*     2)  ZZGFCSLV must be called prior to use of any of the other */
/*         entry points. */

/*     3)  This routine has the following couplings with other */
/*         SPICE routines: */

/*            - The set of allowed aberration corrections must */
/*              be kept in sync with the set supported by the */
/*              SPK API routines. */

/*            - The set of vector definitions must be kept in */
/*              sync with the set supported by GFEVNT. */

/*            - The set of supported coordinate systems must be kept in */
/*              sync with the set supported by zzgf.inc. */
