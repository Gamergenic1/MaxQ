/*     Parameter declarations */
/*     ====================== */

/*     DSK type 2 plate expansion factor */
/*     --------------------------------- */

/*     The factor XFRACT is used to slightly expand plates read from DSK */
/*     type 2 segments in order to perform ray-plate intercept */
/*     computations. */

/*     This expansion is performed to prevent rays from passing through */
/*     a target object without any intersection being detected. Such */
/*     "false miss" conditions can occur due to round-off errors. */

/*     Plate expansion is done by computing the difference vectors */
/*     between a plate's vertices and the plate's centroid, scaling */
/*     those differences by (1 + XFRACT), then producing new vertices by */
/*     adding the scaled differences to the centroid. This process */
/*     doesn't affect the stored DSK data. */

/*     Plate expansion is also performed when surface points are mapped */
/*     to plates on which they lie, as is done for illumination angle */
/*     computations. */

/*     This parameter is user-adjustable. */


/*     The keyword for setting or retrieving this factor is */


/*     Greedy segment selection factor */
/*     ------------------------------- */

/*     The factor SGREED is used to slightly expand DSK segment */
/*     boundaries in order to select segments to consider for */
/*     ray-surface intercept computations. The effect of this factor is */
/*     to make the multi-segment intercept algorithm consider all */
/*     segments that are sufficiently close to the ray of interest, even */
/*     if the ray misses those segments. */

/*     This expansion is performed to prevent rays from passing through */
/*     a target object without any intersection being detected. Such */
/*     "false miss" conditions can occur due to round-off errors. */

/*     The exact way this parameter is used is dependent on the */
/*     coordinate system of the segment to which it applies, and the DSK */
/*     software implementation. This parameter may be changed in a */
/*     future version of SPICE. */


/*     The keyword for setting or retrieving this factor is */


/*     Segment pad margin */
/*     ------------------ */

/*     The segment pad margin is a scale factor used to determine when a */
/*     point resulting from a ray-surface intercept computation, if */
/*     outside the segment's boundaries, is close enough to the segment */
/*     to be considered a valid result. */

/*     This margin is required in order to make DSK segment padding */
/*     (surface data extending slightly beyond the segment's coordinate */
/*     boundaries) usable: if a ray intersects the pad surface outside */
/*     the segment boundaries, the pad is useless if the intercept is */
/*     automatically rejected. */

/*     However, an excessively large value for this parameter is */
/*     detrimental, since a ray-surface intercept solution found "in" a */
/*     segment can supersede solutions in segments farther from the */
/*     ray's vertex. Solutions found outside of a segment thus can mask */
/*     solutions that are closer to the ray's vertex by as much as the */
/*     value of this margin, when applied to a segment's boundary */
/*     dimensions. */

/*     The keyword for setting or retrieving this factor is */


/*     Surface-point membership margin */
/*     ------------------------------- */

/*     The surface-point membership margin limits the distance */
/*     between a point and a surface to which the point is */
/*     considered to belong. The margin is a scale factor applied */
/*     to the size of the segment containing the surface. */

/*     This margin is used to map surface points to outward */
/*     normal vectors at those points. */

/*     If this margin is set to an excessively small value, */
/*     routines that make use of the surface-point mapping won't */
/*     work properly. */


/*     The keyword for setting or retrieving this factor is */


/*     Angular rounding margin */
/*     ----------------------- */

/*     This margin specifies an amount by which angular values */
/*     may deviate from their proper ranges without a SPICE error */
/*     condition being signaled. */

/*     For example, if an input latitude exceeds pi/2 radians by a */
/*     positive amount less than this margin, the value is treated as */
/*     though it were pi/2 radians. */

/*     Units are radians. */


/*     This parameter is not user-adjustable. */

/*     The keyword for retrieving this parameter is */


/*     Longitude alias margin */
/*     ---------------------- */

/*     This margin specifies an amount by which a longitude */
/*     value can be outside a given longitude range without */
/*     being considered eligible for transformation by */
/*     addition or subtraction of 2*pi radians. */

/*     A longitude value, when compared to the endpoints of */
/*     a longitude interval, will be considered to be equal */
/*     to an endpoint if the value is outside the interval */
/*     differs from that endpoint by a magnitude less than */
/*     the alias margin. */


/*     Units are radians. */


/*     This parameter is not user-adjustable. */

/*     The keyword for retrieving this parameter is */

/* $ Detailed_Input */

/*     PRI        is a logical flag indicating whether to perform */
/*                a prioritized or unprioritized DSK segment search. */
/*                In an unprioritized search, no segment masks another: */
/*                data from all specified segments are used to */
/*                define the surface of interest. */

/*                The search is unprioritized if and only if PRI */
/*                is set to .FALSE. In the N0066 SPICE Toolkit, this */
/*                is the only allowed value. */


/*     TARGET     is the name of the target body on which a surface */
/*                intercept is sought. */


/*     NSURF, */
/*     SRFLST     are, respectively, a count of surface ID codes in a */
/*                list and an containing the list. Only DSK segments for */
/*                for the body designated by TARGET and having surface */
/*                IDs in this list will considered in the intercept */
/*                computation. If the list is empty, all DSK segments */
/*                for TARGET will be considered. */


/*     ET         is the epoch of the intersection computation, */
/*                expressed as seconds past J2000 TDB. This epoch is */
/*                used only for DSK segment selection. Segments used */
/*                the intercept computation must include ET in their */
/*                time coverage intervals. */


/*     FIXREF     is the name of a body-fixed, body-centered reference */
/*                frame associated with the target. The input ray vectors */
/*                are specified in this frame, as is the output intercept */
/*                point. */

/*                The frame designated by FIXREF must have a fixed */

/*                used in the computation. */


/*     NRAYS, */
/*     VTXARR, */
/*     DIRARR     are, respectively, a count of rays, an array containing */

/*                direction vectors of the rays. */

/*                The ray's vertices are considered to represent offsets */
/*                from the center of the target body. */

/*                The rays' vertices and direction vectors are */
/*                represented in the reference frame designated by */
/*                FIXREF. */

/* $ Detailed_Output */


/*     XPTARR     is an array containing the intercepts of the input */
/*                rays on the surface specified by the inputs */

/*                   PRI */
/*                   TARGET */

/*                The Ith element of XPTARR is the intercept */
/*                corresponding to the Ith ray, if such an intercept */
/*                exists. If a ray intersects the surface at multiple */

/*                selected. */

/*                The Ith element of XPTARR is defined if and only if the */

/*                Units are km. */


/*     FNDARR     is an array of logical flags indicating whether the */

/*     8)  Any errors that occur during the intercept computation */
/*         will be signaled by routines in the call tree of this */
/*         routine. */

/* $ Files */

/*     Appropriate kernels must be loaded by the calling program before */
/*     this routine is called. */

/*     The following data are required: */

/*        - SPK data: ephemeris data for the positions of the centers */
/*          of DSK reference frames relative to the target body are */
/*          required if those frames are not centered at the target */
/*          body center. */

/*          Typically ephemeris data are made available by loading one */
/*          or more SPK files via FURNSH. */

/*        - DSK data: DSK files containing topographic data for the */
/*          target body must be loaded. If a surface list is specified, */
/*          data for at least one of the listed surfaces must be loaded. */

/*        - Frame data: if a frame definition is required to convert */
/*          DSK segment data to the body-fixed frame designated by */
/*          FIXREF, the target, that definition must be available in the */
/*          kernel pool. Typically the definitions of frames not already */
/*          built-in to SPICE are supplied by loading a frame kernel. */

/*        - CK data: if the frame to which FIXREF refers is a CK frame, */
/*          and if any DSK segments used in the computation have a */
/*          different frame, at least one CK file will be needed to */
/*          permit transformation of vectors between that frame and both */
/*          the J2000 and the target body-fixed frames. */

/*        - SCLK data: if a CK file is needed, an associated SCLK */
/*          kernel is required to enable conversion between encoded SCLK */
/*          (used to time-tag CK data) and barycentric dynamical time */
/*          (TDB). */

/*     In all cases, kernel data are normally loaded once per program */
/*     run, NOT every time this routine is called. */


/* $ Particulars */

/*     This routine is suitable for efficient ray-surface intercept */
/*     computations in which the relative observer-target geometry is */
/*     constant but the rays vary. */

/*     For cases in which it is necessary to know the source of the */
/*     data defining the surface on which an intercept was found, */
/*     use the SPICELIB routine DSKXSI. */

/*     For cases in which a ray's vertex is not explicitly known but is */
/*     defined by relative observer-target geometry, the SPICELIB */
/*     ray-surface intercept routine SINCPT should be used. */

/*     This routine works with multiple DSK files. It places no */
/*     restrictions on the data types or coordinate systems of the DSK */
/*     segments used in the computation. DSK segments using different */
/*     reference frames may be used in a single computation. The only */
/*     restriction is that any pair of reference frames used directly or */
/*     indirectly are related by a constant rotation. */


/*     Using DSK data */
/*     ============== */

/*        DSK loading and unloading */
/*        ------------------------- */

/*        DSK files providing data used by this routine are loaded by */
/*        calling FURNSH and can be unloaded by calling UNLOAD or */
/*        KCLEAR. See the documentation of FURNSH for limits on numbers */
/*        of loaded DSK files. */

/*        For run-time efficiency, it's desirable to avoid frequent */
/*        loading and unloading of DSK files. When there is a reason to */
/*        use multiple versions of data for a given target body---for */
/*        example, if topographic data at varying resolutions are to be */
/*        used---the surface list can be used to select DSK data to be */
/*        used for a given computation. It is not necessary to unload */
/*        the data that are not to be used. This recommendation presumes */
/*        that DSKs containing different versions of surface data for a */
/*        given body have different surface ID codes. */


/*        DSK data priority */
/*        ----------------- */

/*        A DSK coverage overlap occurs when two segments in loaded DSK */
/*        files cover part or all of the same domain---for example, a */
/*        given longitude-latitude rectangle---and when the time */
/*        intervals of the segments overlap as well. */

/*        When DSK data selection is prioritized, in case of a coverage */
/*        overlap, if the two competing segments are in different DSK */
/*        files, the segment in the DSK file loaded last takes */
/*        precedence. If the two segments are in the same file, the */
/*        segment located closer to the end of the file takes */
/*        precedence. */

/*        When DSK data selection is unprioritized, data from competing */
/*        segments are combined. For example, if two competing segments */
/*        both represent a surface as sets of triangular plates, the */
/*        union of those sets of plates is considered to represent the */
/*        surface. */

/*        Currently only unprioritized data selection is supported. */
/*        Because prioritized data selection may be the default behavior */
/*        in a later version of the routine, the presence of the PRI */
/*        argument is required. */


/*        Round-off errors and mitigating algorithms */
/*        ------------------------------------------ */

/*        When topographic data are used to represent the surface of a */
/*        target body, round-off errors can produce some results that */
/*        may seem surprising. */

/*        Note that, since the surface in question might have mountains, */
/*        valleys, and cliffs, the points of intersection found for */
/*        nearly identical sets of inputs may be quite far apart from */
/*        each other: for example, a ray that hits a mountain side in a */
/*        nearly tangent fashion may, on a different host computer, be */
/*        found to miss the mountain and hit a valley floor much farther */
/*        from the observer, or even miss the target altogether. */

/*        Round-off errors can affect segment selection: for example, a */
/*        ray that is expected to intersect the target body's surface */
/*        near the boundary between two segments might hit either */
/*        segment, or neither of them; the result may be */
/*        platform-dependent. */

/*        A similar situation exists when a surface is modeled by a set */
/*        of triangular plates, and the ray is expected to intersect the */
/*        surface near a plate boundary. */

/*        To avoid having the routine fail to find an intersection when */
/*        one clearly should exist, this routine uses two "greedy" */
/*        algorithms: */

/*           1) If the ray passes sufficiently close to any of the */
/*              boundary surfaces of a segment (for example, surfaces of */
/*              maximum and minimum longitude or latitude), that segment */
/*              is tested for an intersection of the ray with the */
/*              surface represented by the segment's data. */

/*              This choice prevents all of the segments from being */
/*              missed when at least one should be hit, but it could, on */
/*              rare occasions, cause an intersection to be found in a */
/*              segment other than the one that would be found if higher */
/*              precision arithmetic were used. */

/*           2) For type 2 segments, which represent surfaces as */
/*              sets of triangular plates, each plate is expanded very */
/*              slightly before a ray-plate intersection test is */
/*              performed. The default plate expansion factor is */

/*                 1 + XFRACT */

/*              where XFRACT is declared in */

/*                 dsktol.inc */

/*              For example, given a value for XFRACT of 1.e-10, the */
/*              sides of the plate are lengthened by 1/10 of a micron */
/*              per km. The expansion keeps the centroid of the plate */
/*              fixed. */

/*              Plate expansion prevents all plates from being missed */
/*              in cases where clearly at least one should be hit. */

/*              As with the greedy segment selection algorithm, plate */
/*              expansion can occasionally cause an intercept to be */
/*              found on a different plate than would be found if higher */
/*              precision arithmetic were used. It also can occasionally */
/*              cause an intersection to be found when the ray misses */
/*              the target by a very small distance. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     The numerical results shown for these examples may differ across */
/*     platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as */
/*     input, the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine */
/*     specific arithmetic implementation. */

/*     1) Compute surface intercepts of rays emanating from a set of */
/*        vertices distributed on a longitude-latitude grid. All */
/*        vertices are outside the target body, and all rays point */
/*        toward the target's center. */

/*        Check intercepts against expected values. Indicate the */
/*        number of errors, the number of computations, and the */
/*        number of intercepts found. */
