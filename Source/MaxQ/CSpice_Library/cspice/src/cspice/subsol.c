/* $ Detailed_Input */

/*     METHOD      is a short string specifying the computation method */
/*                 to be used.  The choices are: */

/*                    'Near point'       The sub-solar point is defined */
/*                                       as the nearest point on the */
/*                                       target to the sun. */

/*                    'Intercept'        The sub-observer point is */
/*                                       defined as the target surface */
/*                                       intercept of the line */
/*                                       containing the target's center */
/*                                       and the sun's center. */

/*                 In both cases, the intercept computation treats the */
/*                 surface of the target body as a triaxial ellipsoid. */
/*                 The ellipsoid's radii must be available in the kernel */
/*                 pool. */

/*                 Neither case nor white space are significant in */
/*                 METHOD.  For example, the string ' NEARPOINT' is */
/*                 valid. */


/*     TARGET      is the name of the target body.  TARGET is */
/*                 case-insensitive, and leading and trailing blanks in */
/*                 TARGET are not significant. Optionally, you may */
/*                 supply a string containing the integer ID code for */
/*                 the object.  For example both 'MOON' and '301' are */
/*                 legitimate strings that indicate the moon is the */
/*                 target body. */

/*                 This routine assumes that the target body is modeled */
/*                 by a tri-axial ellipsoid, and that a PCK file */
/*                 containing its radii has been loaded into the kernel */
/*                 pool via FURNSH. */


/*     ET          is the epoch in ephemeris seconds past J2000 at which */
/*                 the sub-solar point on the target body is to be */
/*                 computed. */


/*     ABCORR      indicates the aberration corrections to be applied */
/*                 when computing the observer-target state.  ABCORR */
/*                 may be any of the following. */

/*                    'NONE'     Apply no correction. Return the */
/*                               geometric sub-solar point on the target */
/*                               body. */

/*                               aberration.  Both the state and rotation */
/*                               of the target body are corrected for one */
/*                               way light time from target to observer. */

/*                               The state of the sun relative to the */
/*                               target is corrected for one way light */
/*                               from the sun to the target; this state */
/*                               is evaluated at the epoch obtained by */
/*                               retarding ET by the one way light time */
/*                               from target to observer. */

/*                    'LT+S'     Correct for planetary (light time) and */

/*                               corrections are the same as in the 'LT' */
/*                               case above.  The target state is */
/*                               additionally corrected for stellar */
/*                               aberration as seen by the observer, and */
/*                               the sun state is corrected for stellar */
/*                               aberration as seen from the target. */

/*                               until the solution converges (three */

/*                 Optionally, you may supply a string containing the */

/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*     SPOINT      is the sub-solar point on the target body at ET */
/*                 expressed relative to the body-fixed frame of the */
/*                 target body. */

/*                 The sub-solar point is defined either as the point on */

/*                 The body-fixed frame, which is time-dependent, is */

/* $ Parameters */

/*     None. */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*     If any of the listed errors occur, the output arguments are */
/*     left unchanged. */


/*     1) If the input argument METHOD is not recognized, the error */
/*        SPICE(DUBIOUSMETHOD) is signaled. */

/*     2) If either of the input body names TARGET or OBSRVR cannot be */
/*        mapped to NAIF integer codes, the error SPICE(IDCODENOTFOUND) */
/*        is signaled. */

/*     3) If OBSRVR and TARGET map to the same NAIF integer ID codes, the */
/*        error SPICE(BODIESNOTDISTINCT) is signaled. */

/*     4) If frame definition data enabling the evaluation of the state */
/*        of the target relative to the observer in target body-fixed */
/*        coordinates have not been loaded prior to calling SUBSOL, the */
/*        error will be diagnosed and signaled by a routine in the call */
/*        tree of this routine. */

/*     5) If the specified aberration correction is not recognized, the */
/*        error will be diagnosed and signaled by a routine in the call */
/*        tree of this routine. */

/*     6) If insufficient ephemeris data have been loaded prior to */
/*        calling SUBSOL, the error will be diagnosed and signaled by a */
/*        routine in the call tree of this routine. */

/*     7) If the triaxial radii of the target body have not been loaded */
/*        into the kernel pool prior to calling SUBSOL, the error will be */
/*        diagnosed and signaled by a routine in the call tree of this */
/*        routine. */

/*     8) The target must be an extended body:  if any of the radii of */
/*        the target body are non-positive, the error will be diagnosed */
/*        and signaled by routines in the call tree of this routine. */

/*     9) If PCK data supplying a rotation model for the target body */
/*        have not been loaded prior to calling SUBSOL, the error will be */
/*        diagnosed and signaled by a routine in the call tree of this */
/*        routine. */

/* $ Files */

/*     Appropriate SPK, PCK, and frame data must be available to */
/*     the calling program before this routine is called.  Typically */
/*     the data are made available by loading kernels; however the */
/*     data may be supplied via subroutine interfaces if applicable. */

/*     The following data are required: */

/*        - SPK data:  ephemeris data for sun, target, and observer must */
/*          be loaded.  If aberration corrections are used, the states of */
/*          sun, target, and observer relative to the solar system */
/*          barycenter must be calculable from the available ephemeris */
/*          data. Ephemeris data are made available by loading */
/*          one or more SPK files via FURNSH. */

/*        - PCK data:  triaxial radii for the target body must be loaded */
/*          into the kernel pool.  Typically this is done by loading a */
/*          text PCK file via FURNSH. */

/*        - Further PCK data:  a rotation model for the target body must */
/*          be loaded.  This may be provided in a text or binary PCK */
/*          file which is loaded via FURNSH. */

/*        - Frame data:  if a frame definition is required to convert */
/*          the sun, observer, and target states to the body-fixed frame */
/*          of the target, that definition must be available in the */
/*          kernel pool.  Typically the definition is supplied by loading */
/*          a frame kernel via FURNSH. */

/*     In all cases, kernel data are normally loaded once per program */
/*     run, NOT every time this routine is called. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     SUBSOL computes the sub-solar point on a target body, as seen by */
/*     a specified observer. */

/*     There are two different popular ways to define the sub-solar */
/*     point:  "nearest point on target to the sun" or "target surface */
/*     intercept of line containing target and sun."  These coincide */
/*     when the target is spherical and generally are distinct otherwise. */

/*     When comparing sub-point computations with results from sources */
/*     other than SPICE, it's essential to make sure the same geometric */
/*     definitions are used. */
