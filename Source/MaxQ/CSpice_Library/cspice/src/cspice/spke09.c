/*     RECORD      is a data record which, when evaluated at epoch ET, */

/*                 reference frame.  Normally, the caller of this routine */
/*                 will obtain RECORD by calling SPKR09. */

/*                 The structure of the record is as follows: */

/*                    | number of states (n) | */

/*         arithmetic overflow may result. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     The exact format and structure of type 9 (unequally spaced */
/*     discrete states, evaluated by Lagrange interpolation) segments are */
/*     described in the SPK Required Reading file. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     The SPKEnn routines are almost always used in conjunction with */
/*     the corresponding SPKRnn routines, which read the records from */
/*     SPK files. */

/*     The data returned by the SPKRnn routine is in its rawest form, */
/*     taken directly from the segment.  As such, it will be meaningless */
/*     to a user unless he/she understands the structure of the data type */
/*     completely.  Given that understanding, however, the SPKRnn */
/*     routines might be used to examine raw segment data before */
/*     evaluating it with the SPKEnn routines. */
