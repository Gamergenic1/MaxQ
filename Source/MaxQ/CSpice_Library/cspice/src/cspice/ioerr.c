/*      VARIABLE  I/O  DESCRIPTION */
/*      --------  ---  -------------------------------------------------- */
/*      ACTION     I   Action which caused the error. */
/*      FILE       I   The name of the file involved. */
/*      IOSTAT     I   The value of IOSTAT returned by ACTION. */

/* $ Detailed_Input */


/*      ACTION    is the action which caused the error. This may */
/*                be the name of a basic operation, such as 'OPEN', */
/*                'READ', or 'WRITE', or may be more sophisticated, */
/*                for example, 'add an empty cluster header to'. */

/*      FILE      is the name of the file involved in the error. */
/*                This may be the system or logical name of a file */
/*                ('USER$DISK:[USER.SUB]TEMP.DAT', 'PLNEPH'), or one */
/*                of the standard files ('SYS$INPUT', 'SYS$OUTPUT'). */

/*      IOSTAT    is the value of IOSTAT returned by ACTION. This */
/*                is appended to the end of the error message. */

/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*     None. */

/* $ Parameters */

/*      None. */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*     None. */

/* $ Files */

/*      None. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*      The input arguments are inserted into the standard form shown */
/*      below.  Spaces are inserted where needed. Leading and trailing */
/*      spaces are removed. */

/*      The long error message is set equal to a standard I/O error */
/*      message, of the form: */

/*                  An error occurred while --------1---------- */
/*                  -------2-------.  The value of IOSTAT returned */
/*                  was --3--. */

/*                where the values of ACTION, FILE, and IOSTAT are */
/*                assigned to positions 1, 2 and 3 */
/*                respectively. */

/*      If the length of the entire composed message exceeds 320 */
/*      characters, it is truncated. */

/*      SIGERR must be called following a call to this routine to */
/*      actually output the resulting long error message to the error */
/*      output device. */

/* $ Examples */

/*      The following example illustrates the use of IOERR. */

/*            CALL IOERR ( 'adding a new header to', */
/*                         EPHEM, */
/*                         24                      ) */

/*      The resulting error message would be: */

/*            'An error occurred while adding a new header */
/*             to LIBDISK:[EPHEM.NESYS]VGR2_T860502.GEF.  The value */
/*             of IOSTAT returned was 24.' */

/*      Note that the user is not responsible for adding and eliminating */
/*      spaces to make the string readable. That is all done */
/*      automatically. */

/*      It is possible to omit the name of the file entirely, as in the */
/*      following (somewhat frivolous) example. */

/*            CALL IOERR ( 'cleaning a fish', */
/*                         ' ', */
/*                         -3                                ) */

/*      The resulting error message would be: */

/*            'An error occurred while cleaning a fish. */
/*             The value of IOSTAT returned was -3.' */

/*      In fact, if the value of IOSTAT is zero, the last part of the */
/*      message is omitted entirely, as in the following example. */

/*            CALL IOERR ( 'writing the status line to', */
/*                         'SYS$OUTPUT', */
/*                         0                                 ) */

/*      The resulting error message would be: */

/*            'An error occurred while writing the status */
/*             line to SYS$OUTPUT.' */
