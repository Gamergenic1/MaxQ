-Brief_I/O
 
   Variable  I/O  Description 
   --------  ---  -------------------------------------------------- 
   ck         I   Name of CK file. 
   ids       I/O  Set of ID codes of objects in CK file. 
 
-Detailed_Input
 
   ck             is the name of a C-kernel. 
    
   ids            is an initialized CSPICE set data structure. 
                  `ids' optionally may contain a set of ID codes on 
                  input; on output, the data already present in 
                  `ids' will be combined with ID code set found for the 
                  file `ck'. 
 
                  If `ids' contains no data on input, its size and 
                  cardinality still must be initialized. 
 
-Detailed_Output
 
   ids            is a CSPICE set data structure which contains 
                  the union of its contents upon input with the set 
                  of ID codes of each object for which pointing data 
                  are present in the indicated CK file. The elements 
                  of CSPICE sets are unique; hence each ID code in 
                  `ids' appears only once, even if the CK file 
                  contains multiple segments for that ID code. 
 
                  See the Examples section below for a complete 
                  example program showing how to retrieve the ID 
                  codes from `ids'. 
                                     
-Parameters
 
   None. 
 
-Exceptions
 
   1)  If the input file has transfer format, the error  
       SPICE(INVALIDFORMAT) is signaled. 
 
   2)  If the input file is not a transfer file but has architecture 
       other than DAF, the error SPICE(BADARCHTYPE) is signaled. 
 
   3)  If the input file is a binary DAF file of type other than 
       CK, the error SPICE(BADFILETYPE) is signaled. 
 
   4)  If the CK file cannot be opened or read, the error will 
       be diagnosed by routines called by this routine. 
 
   5)  If the size of the output set argument `ids' is insufficient to 
       contain the actual number of ID codes of objects covered by 
       the indicated CK file, the error will be diagnosed by 
       routines called by this routine. 
 
   6) The error SPICE(EMPTYSTRING) is signaled if the input
      string `ck' does not contain at least one character, since the
      input string cannot be converted to a Fortran-style string in
      this case.
      
   7) The error SPICE(NULLPOINTER) is signaled if the input string
      pointer `ck' is null.
  
-Files
 
   This routine reads a C-kernel. 
 
-Particulars
 
   This routine provides an API via which applications can determine 
   the set of objects for which there are pointing data in a 
   specified CK file. 
 
-Examples
  
   1)  Display the interval-level coverage for each object in a
       specified CK file. Use tolerance of zero ticks. Do not request
       angular velocity. Express the results in the TDB time system.
 
       Find the set of objects in the file. Loop over the contents of
       the ID code set:  find the coverage for each item in the set and
       display the coverage.

-Version 

   -CSPICE Version 1.0.2, 12-JUL-2016 (EDW)

      Edit to example program to use "%d" with explicit casts
      to int for printing SpiceInts with printf.

   -CSPICE Version 1.0.1, 30-NOV-2007 (NJB)

       Corrected bug in example program in header:
       program now empties result window prior to collecting
       data for each object. Updated example to use wncard_c 
       rather than card_c.
