/*       GENERIC SEGMENTS */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     This include file contains the parameters used by the generic */
/*     segments subroutines, SGxxxx. A generic segment is a */
/*     generalization of a DAF array which places a particular structure */
/*     on the data contained in the array, as described below. */

/*     This file defines the mnemonics that are used for the index types */
/*     allowed in generic segments as well as mnemonics for the meta data */
/*     items which are used to describe a generic segment. */

/*     A DAF generic segment contains several logical data partitions: */

/*        1) A partition for constant values to be associated with each */
/*           data packet in the segment. */

/*        2) A partition for the data packets. */

/*        3) A partition for reference values. */

/*        4) A partition for a packet directory, if the segment contains */
/*           variable sized packets. */

/*        5) A partition for a reference value directory. */

/*        6) A reserved partition that is not currently used. This */
/*           partition is only for the use of the NAIF group at the Jet */
/*           Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). */

/*        7) A partition for the meta data which describes the locations */
/*           and sizes of other partitions as well as providing some */
/*           additional descriptive information about the generic */
/*           segment. */

/*        the maximum allowed index type may be maintained. This value */
/*        must also be updated if new reference index types are added. */

/*     2) If new meta data items are needed, mnemonics for them must be */
/*        added to the end of the current list of mnemonics and before */
/*        the NMETA mnemonic. In this way compatibility with files having */

/*     Two forms of indexing are provided: */

/*        1) An implicit form of indexing based on using two values, a */

/*           value. See the descriptions of the implicit types below for */
/*           the particular formula used in each case. */

/*        2) An explicit form of indexing based on a reference value for */
/*           each data packet. */


/*     Reference Index Type 0 */
/*     ---------------------- */

/*     Implied index. The index and reference value of a data packet */
/*     associated with a specified key value are computed from the two */
/*     generic segment reference values using the formula below. The two */
/*     generic segment reference values, REF(1) and REF(2), represent, */
/*     respectively, a starting value and a step size between reference */
/*     values. The index of the data packet associated with a key value */
/*     of VALUE is given by: */

/*                          /    VALUE - REF(1)    \ */
/*        INDEX = 1  +  INT | -------------------- | */
/*                          \        REF(2)        / */

/*     and the reference value associated with VALUE is given by: */

/*        REFVAL = REF(1) + DBLE (INDEX-1) * REF(2) */


/*     Reference Index Type 1 */
/*     ---------------------- */

/*     Implied index. The index and reference value of a data packet */
/*     associated with a specified key value are computed from the two */
/*     generic segment reference values using the formula below. The two */
/*     generic segment reference values, REF(1) and REF(2), represent, */
/*     respectively, a starting value and a step size between reference */
/*     values. The index of the data packet associated with a key value */
/*     of VALUE is given by: */

/*                          /          VALUE - REF(1)    \ */
/*        INDEX = 1  +  INT | 0.5 + -------------------- | */
/*                          \              REF(2)        / */


/*     and the reference value associated with VALUE is given by: */

/*        REFVAL = REF(1) + DBLE (INDEX-1) * REF(2) */

/*     We get the larger index in the event that VALUE is halfway between */
/*     X(I) and X(I+1), where X(I) = BUFFER(1) + DBLE (I-1) * REFDAT(2). */


/*     Reference Index Type 2 */
/*     ---------------------- */

/*     Explicit index. In this case the number of packets must equal the */
/*     number of reference values. The index of the packet associated */
/*     with a key value of VALUE is the index of the last reference item */
/*     that is strictly less than VALUE. The reference values must be in */
/*     ascending order, REF(I) < REF(I+1). */


/*     Reference Index Type 3 */
/*     ---------------------- */

/*     Explicit index. In this case the number of packets must equal the */
/*     number of reference values. The index of the packet associated */
/*     with a key value of VALUE is the index of the last reference item */
/*     that is less than or equal to VALUE. The reference values must be */
/*     in ascending order, REF(I) < REF(I+1). */


/*     Reference Index Type 4 */
/*     ---------------------- */

/*     Explicit index. In this case the number of packets must equal the */
/*     number of reference values. The index of the packet associated */
/*     with a key value of VALUE is the index of the reference item */
/*     that is closest to the value of VALUE. In the event of a "tie" */
/*     the larger index is selected. The reference values must be in */
/*     ascending order, REF(I) < REF(I+1). */


/*     These parameters define the valid range for the index types. An */
/*     index type code, MYTYPE, for a generic segment must satisfy the */
/*     relation MNIDXT <= MYTYPE <= MXIDXT. */


/*     The following meta data items will appear in all generic segments. */
/*     Other meta data items may be added if a need arises. */

/*       1)  CONBAS  Base Address of the constants in a generic segment. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     This routine begins a type 03 segment in the binary PCK file that */
/*     is associated with HANDLE. The file must have been opened with */
/*     write access. */

/*     This routine is one of a set of three routines for creating and */
/*     adding data to type 03 PCK segments. These routines are: */

/*        PCK03B: Begin a type 03 PCK segment. This routine must be */
/*                called before any data may be added to a type 03 */
/*                segment. */

/*        PCK03A: Add data to a type 03 PCK segment. This routine may be */
/*                called any number of times after a call to PCK03B to */
/*                add type 03 records to the PCK segment that was */
/*                started. */

/*        PCK03E: End a type 03 PCK segment. This routine is called to */
/*                make the type 03 segment a permanent addition to the */
/*                PCK file. Once this routine is called, no further type */
/*                03 records may be added to the segment. A new segment */
/*                must be started. */

/*     A type 03 PCK segment consists of coefficient sets for fixed order */
/*     Chebyshev polynomials over consecutive time intervals, where the */
/*     time intervals need not all be of the same length. The Chebyshev */
/*     polynomials represent the orientation of a body specified relative */
/*     to an inertial frame by the angles RA, DEC, W and body fixed */
/*     angular rates for each axis of the body fixed coordinate system */
/*     defined by RA, DEC, and W. All of the angles and the angular rates */
/*     of the axes are given in degrees. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     Assume we have the following for each of the examples that */
/*     follow. */

/*        HANDLE   is the handle of a PCK file opened with write */
/*                 access. */

/*        SEGID    is a character string of no more than 40 characters */
/*                 which provides a pedigree for the data in the PCK */
/*                 segment. */

/*        BODY     is the SPICE ID code for the body whose orientation */
/*                 data is to be placed into the file. */

/*        REFFRM   is the name of the SPICE inertial reference frame */
/*                 the orientation data is relative to. */

/*        FIRST    is the starting epoch, in seconds past J2000, for */
/*                 the orientation data to be placed into the segment. */

/*        LAST     is the ending epoch, in seconds past J2000, for */
/*                 the orientation data to be placed into the segment. */

/*     Example 1: */

/*        For this example, we also assume that: */

/*           N        is the number of type 03 records that we want to */
/*                    put into a segment in PCK file. */

/*           RECRDS   contains N type 03 records packaged for the PCK */
/*                    file. */

/*           ETSTRT   contains the initial epochs for each of the */
/*                    records contained in RECRDS, where */

/*                       ETSTRT(I) < ETSTRT(I+1), I = 1, N-1 */

/*                       ETSTRT(1) <= FIRST, ETSTRT(N) < LAST */

/*                       ETSTRT(I+1), I = 1, N-1, is the ending epoch for */
/*                       record I as well as the initial epoch for record */
/*                       I+1. */

/*        Then the following code fragment demonstrates how to create a */
/*        type 03 PCK segment if all of the data for the segment is */
/*        available at one time. */

/*        C */
/*        C     Begin the segment. */

/*              CALL PCK03B ( HANDLE, SEGID, BODY, REFFRM, */
/*             .              FIRST,  LAST,  CHBDEG        ) */
/*        C */
/*        C     Add the data to the segment all at once. */
/*        C */
/*              CALL PCK03A ( HANDLE, N, RECRDS, ETSTRT ) */
/*        C */
/*        C     End the segment, making the segment a permanent addition */
/*        C     to the PCK file. */
/*        C */
/*              CALL PCK03E ( HANDLE ) */

/*     Example 2: */

/*        In this example we want to add type O3 PCK records, as */
/*        described above in the $ Particulars section, to the segment */
/*        being written as they are generated. The ability to write the */
/*        records in this way is useful if computer memory is limited. It */
/*        may also be convenient from a programming perspective to write */
/*        the records one at a time. */

/*        For this example, assume that we want to generate N type 03 PCK */
/*        records, one for each of N time intervals, writing them all to */
/*        the same segment in a PCK file. Let */

/*           N        be the number of type 03 records that we want to */
/*                    generate and put into a segment in an PCK file. */

/*                    03 record, i.e. RECORD should have dimension at */

/*                    for each of the intervals of interest. The times */
/*                    should be in increasing order and the stop time for */
/*                    interval I should equal the start time for interval */
/*                    I+1, i.e., we want to have continuous coverage in */
/*                    time across all of the records. Also, the stop time */
/*                    for the last interval should equal the ending time */
/*                    for the segment. */
