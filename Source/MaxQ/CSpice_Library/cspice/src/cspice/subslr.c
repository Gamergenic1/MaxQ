/*                 received radiation or omitted. LT is computed using */
/*                 the method indicated by ABCORR. */

/*                 TRGEPC is expressed as seconds past J2000 TDB. */


/*     SRFVEC      is the vector from the observer's position at ET to */

/*                 position of SPOINT, where the aberration corrections */
/*                 are specified by ABCORR. SRFVEC is expressed in the */
/*                 target body-fixed reference frame designated by */
/*                 FIXREF, evaluated at TRGEPC. */

/*                 The components of SRFVEC are given in units of km. */

/*                 One can use the SPICELIB function VNORM to obtain the */
/*                 distance between the observer and SPOINT: */

/*                    DIST = VNORM ( SRFVEC ) */

/*                 The observer's position OBSPOS, relative to the */

/*                    CALL VSUB ( SPOINT, SRFVEC, OBSPOS ) */

/* $ Parameters */

/*     None. */

/* $ Exceptions */


/*     1)  If the specified aberration correction is unrecognized, the */
/*         error will be diagnosed and signaled by a routine in the call */
/*         tree of this routine. */

/*         If transmission aberration corrections are specified, the */
/*         error SPICE(NOTSUPPORTED) is signaled. */

/*     2)  If either the target or observer input strings cannot be */
/*         converted to an integer ID code, the error */
/*         SPICE(IDCODENOTFOUND) is signaled. */

/*     3)  If the input target body-fixed frame FIXREF is not */
/*         recognized, the error SPICE(NOFRAME) is signaled. A frame */
/*         name may fail to be recognized because a required frame */
/*         specification kernel has not been loaded; another cause is a */
/*         misspelling of the frame name. */

/*     4)  If the input frame FIXREF is not centered at the target body, */
/*         the error SPICE(INVALIDFRAME) is signaled. */

/*     5)  If the input argument METHOD is not recognized, the error */
/*         SPICE(INVALIDMETHOD) is signaled by this routine, or the */
/*         error is diagnosed by a routine in the call tree of this */
/*         routine. */

/*         If the sub-solar point type is not specified or is not */
/*         recognized, the error SPICE(INVALIDSUBTYPE) is signaled. */

/*     6)  If insufficient ephemeris data have been loaded prior to */
/*         calling SUBSLR, the error will be diagnosed and signaled by a */
/*         routine in the call tree of this routine. Note that when */
/*         light time correction is used, sufficient ephemeris data must */
/*         be available to propagate the states of observer, target, and */
/*         the Sun to the solar system barycenter. */

/*     7)  If the computation method specifies an ellipsoidal target */
/*         shape and triaxial radii of the target body have not been */
/*         loaded into the kernel pool prior to calling SUBSLR, the */
/*         error will be diagnosed and signaled by a routine in the call */
/*         tree of this routine. */

/*     8)  The target must be an extended body, and must have a shape */
/*         for which a sub-solar point can be defined. */

/*         If the target body's shape is modeled as an ellipsoid, and if */
/*         any of the radii of the target body are non-positive, the */
/*         error will be diagnosed and signaled by routines in the call */
/*         tree of this routine. */

/*         If the target body's shape is modeled by DSK data, the shape */
/*         must be such that the specified sub-solar point definition is */
/*         applicable. For example, if the target shape is a torus, both */
/*         the NADIR and INTERCEPT definitions might be inapplicable, */
/*         depending on the relative locations of the sun and target. */

/*     9)  If PCK data specifying the target body-fixed frame */
/*         orientation have not been loaded prior to calling SUBSLR, */
/*         the error will be diagnosed and signaled by a routine in the */
/*         call tree of this routine. */

/*     10) If METHOD specifies that the target surface is represented by */
/*         DSK data, and no DSK files are loaded for the specified */
/*         target, the error is signaled by a routine in the call tree */
/*         of this routine. */

/*     12) If METHOD specifies that the target surface is represented */
/*         by DSK data, and the ray from the observer to the */
/*         sub-observer point doesn't intersect the target body's */
/*         surface, the error SPICE(SUBPOINTNOTFOUND) will be signaled. */

/*     13) In some very rare cases, the surface intercept on the */
/*         target body's reference ellipsoid of the observer to target */
/*         center vector may not be computable. In these cases the */
/*         error SPICE(DEGENERATECASE) is signaled. */

/*     14) If the target body is the sun, the error SPICE(INVALIDTARGET) */
/*         is signaled. */

/* $ Files */

/*     Appropriate kernels must be loaded by the calling program before */
/*     this routine is called. */

/*     The following data are required: */

/*        - SPK data: ephemeris data for target, observer, and Sun must */
/*          be loaded. If aberration corrections are used, the states of */
/*          target, observer, and the Sun relative to the solar system */
/*          barycenter must be calculable from the available ephemeris */
/*          data. Typically ephemeris data are made available by loading */
/*          one or more SPK files via FURNSH. */

/*        - PCK data: rotation data for the target body must be */
/*          loaded. These may be provided in a text or binary PCK file. */

/*        - Shape data for the target body: */

/*            PCK data: */

/*               If the target body shape is modeled as an ellipsoid, */
/*               triaxial radii for the target body must be loaded into */
/*               the kernel pool. Typically this is done by loading a */
/*               text PCK file via FURNSH. */

/*               Triaxial radii are also needed if the target shape is */
/*               modeled by DSK data, but the DSK NADIR method is */
/*               selected. */

/*            DSK data: */

/*               If the target shape is modeled by DSK data, DSK files */
/*               containing topographic data for the target body must be */
/*               loaded. If a surface list is specified, data for at */
/*               least one of the listed surfaces must be loaded. */

/*     The following data may be required: */

/*        - Frame data: if a frame definition is required to convert the */
/*          observer and target states to the body-fixed frame of the */
/*          target, that definition must be available in the kernel */
/*          pool. Typically the definition is supplied by loading a */
/*          frame kernel via FURNSH. */

/*        - Surface name-ID associations: if surface names are specified */
/*          in METHOD, the association of these names with their */
/*          corresponding surface ID codes must be established by */
/*          assignments of the kernel variables */

/*             NAIF_SURFACE_NAME */
/*             NAIF_SURFACE_CODE */
/*             NAIF_SURFACE_BODY */

/*          Normally these associations are made by loading a text */
/*          kernel containing the necessary assignments. An example */
/*          of such an assignment is */

/*             NAIF_SURFACE_NAME += 'Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG' */
/*             NAIF_SURFACE_CODE += 1 */
/*             NAIF_SURFACE_BODY += 499 */

/*     In all cases, kernel data are normally loaded once per program */
/*     run, NOT every time this routine is called. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     There are two different popular ways to define the sub-solar */
/*     point: "nearest point on target to the Sun" or "target surface */
/*     intercept of the line containing the Sun and target." These */
/*     coincide when the target is spherical and generally are distinct */
/*     otherwise. */

/*     This routine computes light time corrections using light time */
/*     between the observer and the sub-solar point, as opposed to the */
/*     center of the target. Similarly, stellar aberration corrections */
/*     done by this routine are based on the direction of the vector */
/*     from the observer to the light-time corrected sub-solar point, */
/*     not to the target center. This technique avoids errors due to the */
/*     differential between aberration corrections across the target */
/*     body. Therefore it's valid to use aberration corrections with */
/*     this routine even when the observer is very close to the */
/*     sub-solar point, in particular when the observer to sub-solar */
/*     point distance is much less than the observer to target center */
/*     distance. */

/*     When comparing sub-solar point computations with results from */
/*     sources other than SPICE, it's essential to make sure the same */
/*     geometric definitions are used. */


/*     Using DSK data */
/*     ============== */

/*        DSK loading and unloading */
/*        ------------------------- */

/*        DSK files providing data used by this routine are loaded by */
/*        calling FURNSH and can be unloaded by calling UNLOAD or */
/*        KCLEAR. See the documentation of FURNSH for limits on numbers */
/*        of loaded DSK files. */

/*        For run-time efficiency, it's desirable to avoid frequent */
/*        loading and unloading of DSK files. When there is a reason to */
/*        use multiple versions of data for a given target body---for */
/*        example, if topographic data at varying resolutions are to be */
/*        used---the surface list can be used to select DSK data to be */
/*        used for a given computation. It is not necessary to unload */
/*        the data that are not to be used. This recommendation presumes */
/*        that DSKs containing different versions of surface data for a */
/*        given body have different surface ID codes. */


/*        DSK data priority */
/*        ----------------- */

/*        A DSK coverage overlap occurs when two segments in loaded DSK */
/*        files cover part or all of the same domain---for example, a */
/*        given longitude-latitude rectangle---and when the time */
/*        intervals of the segments overlap as well. */

/*        When DSK data selection is prioritized, in case of a coverage */
/*        overlap, if the two competing segments are in different DSK */
/*        files, the segment in the DSK file loaded last takes */
/*        precedence. If the two segments are in the same file, the */
/*        segment located closer to the end of the file takes */
/*        precedence. */

/*        When DSK data selection is unprioritized, data from competing */
/*        segments are combined. For example, if two competing segments */
/*        both represent a surface as sets of triangular plates, the */
/*        union of those sets of plates is considered to represent the */
/*        surface. */

/*        Currently only unprioritized data selection is supported. */
/*        Because prioritized data selection may be the default behavior */
/*        in a later version of the routine, the UNPRIORITIZED keyword is */
/*        required in the METHOD argument. */


/*        Syntax of the METHOD input argument */
/*        ----------------------------------- */

/*        The keywords and surface list in the METHOD argument */
/*        are called "clauses." The clauses may appear in any */
/*        order, for example */

/*           NADIR/DSK/UNPRIORITIZED/<surface list> */
/*           DSK/NADIR/<surface list>/UNPRIORITIZED */
/*           UNPRIORITIZED/<surface list>/DSK/NADIR */

/*        The simplest form of the METHOD argument specifying use of */
/*        DSK data is one that lacks a surface list, for example: */

/*           'NADIR/DSK/UNPRIORITIZED' */
/*           'INTERCEPT/DSK/UNPRIORITIZED' */

/*        For applications in which all loaded DSK data for the target */
/*        body are for a single surface, and there are no competing */
/*        segments, the above strings suffice. This is expected to be */
/*        the usual case. */

/*        When, for the specified target body, there are loaded DSK */
/*        files providing data for multiple surfaces for that body, the */
/*        surfaces to be used by this routine for a given call must be */
/*        specified in a surface list, unless data from all of the */
/*        surfaces are to be used together. */

/*        The surface list consists of the string */

/*           SURFACES = */

/*        followed by a comma-separated list of one or more surface */
/*        identifiers. The identifiers may be names or integer codes in */
/*        string format. For example, suppose we have the surface */
/*        names and corresponding ID codes shown below: */

/*           Surface Name                              ID code */
/*           ------------                              ------- */
/*           'Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG'                1 */
/*           'Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG'                 2 */
/*           'Mars_MRO_HIRISE'                         3 */

/*        If data for all of the above surfaces are loaded, then */
/*        data for surface 1 can be specified by either */

/*           'SURFACES = 1' */

/*        or */

/*           'SURFACES = "Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG"' */

/*        Double quotes are used to delimit the surface name because */
/*        it contains blank characters. */

/*        To use data for surfaces 2 and 3 together, any */
/*        of the following surface lists could be used: */

/*           'SURFACES = 2, 3' */

/*           'SURFACES = "Mars MEGDR  64 PIXEL/DEG", 3' */

/*           'SURFACES = 2, Mars_MRO_HIRISE' */

/*           'SURFACES = "Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG", Mars_MRO_HIRISE' */

/*        An example of a METHOD argument that could be constructed */
/*        using one of the surface lists above is */

/*        'NADIR/DSK/UNPRIORITIZED/SURFACES= "Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG",3' */


/*        Aberration corrections */
/*        ---------------------- */

/*        For irregularly shaped target bodies, the distance between the */
/*        observer and the nearest surface intercept need not be a */
/*        continuous function of time; hence the one-way light time */
/*        between the intercept and the observer may be discontinuous as */
/*        well. In such cases, the computed light time, which is found */
/*        using an iterative algorithm, may converge slowly or not at */
/*        all. In all cases, the light time computation will terminate, */
/*        but the result may be less accurate than expected. */


/* $ Examples */


/*     The numerical results shown for this example may differ across */
/*     platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input, */
/*     the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine specific */
/*     arithmetic implementation. */


/*     1) Find the sub-solar point on Mars as seen from the Earth for a */
/*        specified time. */

/*        Compute the sub-solar point using both triaxial ellipsoid */
/*        and topographic surface models. Topography data are provided by */
/*        a DSK file. For the ellipsoid model, use both the "intercept" */
/*        and "near point" sub-observer point definitions; for the DSK */
/*        case, use both the "intercept" and "nadir" definitions. */

/*        Display the locations of both the sun and the sub-solar */

/*        The topographic model is based on data from the MGS MOLA DEM */
/*        megr90n000cb, which has a resolution of 4 pixels/degree. A */
/*        triangular plate model was produced by computing a 720 x 1440 */
/*        grid of interpolated heights from this DEM, then tessellating */
/*        the height grid. The plate model is stored in a type 2 segment */
/*        in the referenced DSK file. */

/* -    SPICELIB Version 3.0.0, 04-APR-2017 (NJB) */

/*        Added FAILED tests. */

/*        Now uses surface mapping tracking capability. */
/*        Updated header. */

/*       09-FEB-2015 (NJB) */

/*        Support for surface specification was added. */
/*        Header was updated to document DSK features. */

/*       24-DEC-2014 (NJB) */

/*        Updated to support DSK data. */

/* -    SPICELIB Version 2.0.0, 31-MAR-2014 (NJB) (SCK) (BVS) */

/*        Bug fix: stellar aberration is no longer applied to the */
/*        observer-to-estimated sub-solar point vector while solving for */
/*        the sub-solar point. This correction involved unnecessary code */
/*        but did not affect this routine's outputs. */

/*        Bug fix: FIRST is now set to .FALSE. at the completion of a */
/*        successful initialization pass. This does not affect the */
/*        routine's outputs but improves efficiency. */

/*        Exceptions removed: the observer and target are now */
/*        permitted to coincide. */

/*        Upgrade: the algorithm for finding the apparent state of the */
/*        sun as seen from the estimated sub-solar point has been */
/*        improved. */

/*        Upgrade: this routine now uses ZZVALCOR rather than ZZPRSCOR, */
/*        simplifying the implementation. */

/*        The header example program was updated to reflect the new */
/*        method of computing the apparent sun location, and the set */
/*        of kernels referenced by the example meta-kernel were updated. */
/*        The display of the program's output was updated accordingly. */

/*        References to the new PXFRM2 routine were added, which changed */
/*        the Detailed Output section. */

/*        Updated to save the input body names and ZZBODTRN state */
/*        counters and to do name-ID conversions only if the counters */
/*        have changed. */

/*        Updated to save the input frame name and POOL state counter */
/*        and to do frame name-ID conversion only if the counter has */
/*        changed. */

/*        Updated to call LJUCRS instead of CMPRSS/UCASE. */

/* -    SPICELIB Version 1.1.0, 18-MAY-2010 (NJB) */

/*        Bug fix: calls to FAILED() have been added after */
/*        SPK calls, target radius lookup, near point */
/*        and surface intercept computations. */

/* -    SPICELIB Version 1.0.1, 17-MAR-2009 (NJB) */

/*        Typo correction: changed FIXFRM to FIXREF in header */
/*        documentation. Meta-kernel name suffix was changed to */
/*        ".tm" in header code example. */

/*        Typo correction in Required_Reading, changed */
