/* $ Detailed_Input */

/*     LIST           is a node in the list to be inserted.  The entire */
/*                    list containing LIST is to be inserted into the */
/*                    list containing NEXT.  The inserted list will be */
/*                    located between NEXT and its predecessor, if any. */

/*     NEXT           is a node in a list.  NEXT is permitted to be */
/*                    nil, in which case POOL is not modified. */

/*     POOL           is a doubly linked list pool. */

/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*     POOL           is the input pool, with the following */
/*                    modifications: */

/*                       Let HEAD and TAIL be the head and tail nodes of */
/*                       the list containing LIST.  Then on output */

/*                          -- The successor of TAIL is NEXT. */

/*                          -- The predecessor of NEXT is TAIL. */


/*                       Let PREV be the node that on input was the */
/*                       predecessor of NEXT; if PREV exists, then on */
/*                       output */

/*                          -- The successor of PREV is HEAD. */

/*                          -- The predecessor of HEAD is PREV. */

/*                       If PREV is nil, the backward pointer of the */
/*                       inserted sublist is set to the negative of */
/*                       the tail of the list containing NEXT. */

/* $ Parameters */

/*     LBPOOL        is the lower bound of the column indices of the POOL */
/*                   array.  The columns indexed LBPOOL to 0 are reserved */
/*                   as a control area for the pool. */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*     1)  If LIST is not a valid node number, the error */
/*         SPICE(INVALIDNODE) will be signalled.  POOL will not be */
/*         modified. */

/*     2)  If NEXT is positive but is not a valid node number, the error */
/*         SPICE(INVALIDNODE) will be signalled.  POOL will not be */
/*         modified. */

/*     3)  It is not an error for NEXT to be non-positive; if it is, */
/*         the call to this routine does not affect the pool. */

/*     4)  If either of LIST or NEXT are valid node numbers but are */
/*         not allocated, the error SPICE(UNALLOCATEDNODE) will be */
/*         signalled.  POOL will not be modified. */

/*     5)  If LIST belongs to the same list as does NEXT, this routine */
/*         may fail in mysterious ways.  For efficiency, this error */
/*         condition is not checked. */

/*     For efficiency, discovery check-in is used in this routine. */

/* $ Files */

/*     None. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     This routine is used for augmenting lists by inserting other */
/*     lists into them.  The case of insertion of a single allocated */
/*     node is not special:  this is insertion of a singleton list. */

/*     To insert a list into a list AFTER a specified element, use the */
/*     routine LNKILA. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     1)  Let POOL be a doubly linked list pool that contains the lists */

/*             3 <--> 7 <--> 1    and    500 <--> 2 <--> 80 */

/*         To insert the second list into the first before node 7, use */
/*         the call */

/*             CALL LNKILB ( 500, 7, POOL ) */

/*         The resulting list will be: */

/*             3 <--> 500 <--> 2 <--> 80 <--> 7 <--> 1 */


/*     2)  Let POOL be a doubly linked list pool that contains 5 nodes. */
/*         The sequence of calls */

/*            HEAD = 0 */

/*            DO I = 1, 5 */
/*               CALL LNKAN  ( POOL, NODE       ) */
/*               CALL LNKILB ( NODE, HEAD, POOL ) */
/*               HEAD = NODE */
/*            END DO */

/*         builds the list */

/*             5 <--> 4 <--> 3 <--> 2 <--> 1 */

/*         Note that the first call to LNKILB does not cause an error */
/*         to be signalled, even though HEAD is 0 at that point. */

/* $ Restrictions */

/*     Linked list pools must be initialized via the routine */
/*     LNKINI.  Failure to initialize a linked list pool */
/*     will almost certainly lead to confusing results. */
