/*        ekfilpar.inc  Version 1  03-APR-1995 (NJB) */

/*     These parameters apply to EK files using architecture 4. */
/*     These files use a paged DAS file as their underlying file */
/*     structure. */

/*     In paged DAS EK files, data pages are structured:  they contain */
/*     metadata as well as data.  The metadata is located in the last */
/*     few addresses of each page, so as to interfere as little as */
/*     possible with calculation of data addresses. */

/*     Each data page belongs to exactly one segment.  Some bookkeeping */
/*     information, such as record pointers, is also stored in data */
/*     pages. */

/*     Each page contains a forward pointer that allows rapid lookup */
/*     of data items that span multiple pages.  Each page also keeps */
/*     track of the current number of links from its parent segment */
/*     to the page.  Link counts enable pages to `know' when they */
/*     are no longer in use by a segment; unused pages are deallocated */
/*     and returned to the free list. */

/*     The parameters in this include file depend on the parameters */
/*     declared in the include file ekpage.inc.  If those parameters */
/*     change, this file must be updated.  The specified parameter */
/*     declarations we need from that file are: */

/*        INTEGER               PGSIZC */
/*        PARAMETER           ( PGSIZC = 1024 ) */

/*        INTEGER               PGSIZD */
/*        PARAMETER           ( PGSIZD = 128 ) */

/*        INTEGER               PGSIZI */
/*        PARAMETER           ( PGSIZI = 256 ) */



/*     Character pages use an encoding mechanism to represent integer */
/*     metadata.  Each integer is encoded in five consecutive */
/*     characters. */

/* $ Detailed_Input */

/*     HANDLE         is the handle of an EK file open for write access. */

/*     ADDRSS         is the DAS character start address at which an */
/*                    integer, encoded as a string, is to be written. */
/*                    An encoded integer occupies ENCSIZ characters, */
/*                    where the parameter ENCSIZ is defined in the */
/*                    include file ekdatpag.inc. */

/*     IVAL           is an integer value to be written in encoded form. */

/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*     None.  See $Particulars for a description of the effect of this */
/*     routine. */

/* $ Parameters */

/*     None. */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*     1)  If HANDLE is invalid, the error will be diagnosed by routines */
/*         called by this routine. */

/*     2)  If the DAS character address range */

/*            ADDRSS .. ADDRSS+ENCSIZ-1 */

/*         is not a range of DAS character addresses that have been */
/*         initialized, the error wll be diagnosed by routines */
/*         called by this routine. */

/* $ Files */

/*     None. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     This routine should be used for all EK applications requiring */
/*     storage of encoded integer values as characters.  Use of this */
/*     routine should ensure consistent encoding across the library. */

/*     Encoded integers written by this routine should be read using */
/*     ZZEKGEI. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     See ZZEKAD03. */

/* $ Restrictions */

/*     1)  Portability dictates that the base used for encoding be */
/*         no greater than 128. */

/* $ Literature_References */

/*     None. */
