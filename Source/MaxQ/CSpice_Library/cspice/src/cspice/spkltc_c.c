-Detailed_Input
 
   targ        is the NAIF ID code for a target body. The target 
               and observer define a state vector whose position 
               component points from the observer to the target. 
 
   et          is the ephemeris time, expressed as seconds past 
               J2000 TDB, at which the state of the target body 
               relative to the observer is to be computed. `et' 
               refers to time at the observer's location.

   ref         is the inertial reference frame with respect to which
               the input state `stobs' and the output state `starg' are
               expressed. `ref' must be recognized by the CSPICE
               Toolkit. The acceptable frames are listed in the Frames
               Required Reading, as well as in the CSPICE routine
               chgirf_.
 
               Case and blanks are not significant in the string
               `ref'.
 
   abcorr      indicates the aberration corrections to be applied to 
               the state of the target body to account for one-way 
               light time. See the discussion in the Particulars 
               section for recommendations on how to choose 
               aberration corrections. 
                 
               If `abcorr' includes the stellar aberration correction 
               symbol "+S", this flag is simply ignored. Aside from 
               the possible presence of this symbol, `abcorr' may be 
               any of the following: 
 
                  "NONE"     Apply no correction. Return the  
                             geometric state of the target body  
                             relative to the observer.  
 
               The following values of `abcorr' apply to the 
               "reception" case in which photons depart from the 
               target's location at the light-time corrected epoch 
               et-lt and *arrive* at the observer's location at `et': 
 
                  "LT"       Correct for one-way light time (also 
                             called "planetary aberration") using a 
                             Newtonian formulation. This correction 
                             yields the state of the target at the 
                             moment it emitted photons arriving at 
                             the observer at `et'. 
  
                             The light time correction involves 
                             iterative solution of the light time 
                             equation (see Particulars for details). 
                             The solution invoked by the "LT" option 
                             uses one iteration. 
 
                  "CN"       Converged Newtonian light time
                             correction. In solving the light time
                             equation, the "CN" correction iterates
                             until the solution converges (three
                             iterations on all supported platforms).
                             Whether the "CN+S" solution is
                             substantially more accurate than the
                             "LT" solution depends on the geometry
                             of the participating objects and on the
                             accuracy of the input data. In all
                             cases this routine will execute more
                             slowly when a converged solution is
                             computed. See the Particulars section of
                             spkezr_c for a discussion of precision of
                             light time corrections.

 
               The following values of `abcorr' apply to the 
               "transmission" case in which photons *depart* from 
               the observer's location at `et' and arrive at the 
               target's location at the light-time corrected epoch 
               et+lt: 
 
                  "XLT"      "Transmission" case:  correct for 
                             one-way light time using a Newtonian 
                             formulation. This correction yields the 
                             state of the target at the moment it 
                             receives photons emitted from the 
                             observer's location at `et'. 
 
                  "XCN"      "Transmission" case:  converged  
                             Newtonian light time correction. 
 
 
               Neither special nor general relativistic effects are 
               accounted for in the aberration corrections applied 
               by this routine. 
 
               Case and blanks are not significant in the string 
               `abcorr'. 
                                
   stobs       is the geometric state of the observer relative 
               to the solar system barycenter at `et'. The 
               target and observer define a state vector whose 
               position component points from the observer to the 
               target. `stobs' is expressed relative to the reference
               frame designated by `ref'.
 
-Detailed_Output
 
   starg       is a Cartesian state vector representing the position 
               and velocity of the target body relative to the 
               specified observer. `starg' is corrected for the 
               specified aberration, and is expressed with respect 
               to the specified inertial reference frame. The first 
               three components of `starg' represent the x-, y- and 
               z-components of the target's position; last three 
               components form the corresponding velocity vector. 
 
               The position component of `starg' points from the 
               observer's location at `et' to the aberration-corrected 
               location of the target. Note that the sense of the 
               position vector is independent of the direction of 
               radiation travel implied by the aberration 
               correction. 
 
               Units are always km and km/sec. 
 
   lt          is the one-way light time between the observer and 
               target in seconds. If the target state is corrected 
               for light time, then `lt' is the one-way light time  
               between the observer and the light time-corrected  
               target location. 
 
   dlt         is the derivative with respect to barycentric 
               dynamical time of the one way light time between 
               target and observer: 
 
                  dlt = d(lt)/d(et) 
 
               `dlt' can also be described as the rate of change of  
               one way light time. `dlt' is unitless, since `lt' and 
               `et' both have units of TDB seconds. 
 
               If the observer and target are at the same position, 
               then `dlt' is set to zero. 
  
-Parameters
 
   None. 
 
-Exceptions
 
   1)  For the convenience of the caller, the input aberration 
       correction flag can call for stellar aberration correction via
       inclusion of the '+S' suffix. This portion of the aberration
       correction flag is ignored if present.
 
   2)  If `abcorr' calls for stellar aberration but not light
       time corrections, the error SPICE(NOTSUPPORTED) is
       signaled.

   3)  If `abcorr' calls for relativistic light time corrections, the
       error SPICE(NOTSUPPORTED) is signaled.

   4)  If the value of `abcorr' is not recognized, the error 
       is diagnosed by routines in the call tree of this routine.

   5)  If the reference frame requested is not a recognized 
       inertial reference frame, the error SPICE(BADFRAME)  
       is signaled. 
 
   6)  If the state of the target relative to the solar system 
       barycenter cannot be computed, the error is diagnosed  
       by routines in the call tree of this routine. 
 
   7)  If the observer and target are at the same position, 
       then `dlt' is set to zero. This situation could arise, 
       for example, when the observer is Mars and the target 
       is the Mars barycenter. 
 
   8)  If a division by zero error would occur in the computation 
       of `dlt', the error SPICE(DIVIDEBYZERO) is signaled. 
 
   9)  The error SPICE(EMPTYSTRING) is signaled if either of the input
       strings `ref' or `abcorr' do not contain at least one character,
       since such an input string cannot be converted to a
       Fortran-style string.
      
   10) The error SPICE(NULLPOINTER) is signaled if either of the input 
       string pointers `ref' or `abcorr' are null.

-Files
 
   This routine computes states using SPK files that have been 
   loaded into the SPICE system, normally via the kernel loading 
   interface routine furnsh_c. Application programs typically load 
   kernels once before this routine is called, for example during 
   program initialization; kernels need not be loaded repeatedly. 
   See the routine furnsh_c and the SPK and KERNEL Required Reading 
   for further information on loading (and unloading) kernels. 
 
   If any of the ephemeris data used to compute `starg' are expressed 
   relative to a non-inertial frame in the SPK files providing those 
   data, additional kernels may be needed to enable the reference 
   frame transformations required to compute the state. Normally 
   these additional kernels are PCK files or frame kernels. Any 
   such kernels must already be loaded at the time this routine is 
   called. 
 
-Particulars
 
   This routine supports higher-level SPK API routines that can 
   perform both light time and stellar aberration corrections. 
   User applications normally will not need to call this routine 
   directly. 
 
   See the header of the routine spkezr_c for a detailed discussion 
   of aberration corrections. 
 
-Examples
 

   1) Look up a sequence of states of the Moon as seen from the
      Earth. Use light time corrections. Compute the first state for
      the epoch 2000 JAN 1 12:00:00 TDB; compute subsequent states at
      intervals of 1 hour. For each epoch, display the states, the one
      way light time between target and observer, and the rate of
      change of the one way light time.

      Use the following meta-kernel to specify the kernels to
      load:

         KPL/MK

         This meta-kernel is intended to support operation of SPICE
         example programs. The kernels shown here should not be
         assumed to contain adequate or correct versions of data
         required by SPICE-based user applications.

         In order for an application to use this meta-kernel, the
         kernels referenced here must be present in the user's
         current working directory.

               Before we can execute this computation, we'll need 
               the geometric state of the observer relative to the 
               solar system barycenter at ET, expressed relative 
               to the J2000 reference frame:

-Restrictions
 
   1) The kernel files to be used by spkltc_c must be loaded 
      (normally by the CSPICE kernel loader furnsh_c) before  
      this routine is called. 
 
   2) Unlike most other SPK state computation routines, this 
      routine requires that the output state be relative to an 
      inertial reference frame.

       Discussion of light time corrections was updated. Assertions
       that converged light time corrections are unlikely to be
       useful were removed.
