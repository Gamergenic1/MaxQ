   Variable  I/O  Description 
   --------  ---  -------------------------------------------------- 
   handle     I   Handle of an open DAF file. 
   lenout     I   Available room in the output string `ifname'.
   nd         O   Number of double precision components in summaries. 
   ni         O   Number of integer components in summaries. 
   ifname     O   Internal file name. 
   fward      O   Forward list pointer. 
   bward      O   Backward list pointer. 
   free       O   Free address pointer. 
 
-Detailed_Input
 
   handle         is the handle assigned to a DAF file opened for 
                  reading. 

   lenout         is the maximum number of characters that can be 
                  accommodated in the output string `ifname'. This count 
                  includes room for the terminating null character.
                  DAF internal file names may contain up to 60 
                  characters, so lenout normally should be set to 61.

-Detailed_Output
 
   nd, 
   ni          are the numbers of double precision and integer 
               components, respectively, in each array summary in 
               the specified file. 
 
   ifname      is the internal file name stored in the first 
               (or file) record of the specified file. `ifname'
               should be declared with the length specified by
               `lenout'.
 
   fward       is the forward list pointer. This points to the 
               first summary record in the file. (Records between 
               the first record and the first summary record are 
               reserved when the file is created, and are invisible 
               to DAF routines.) 

               DAF list pointers are actually Fortran record numbers,
               and as such, start at one.
 
   bward       is the backward list pointer. This points 
               to the final summary record in the file. 

 
   free        is the free address pointer. This contains the 
               first free address in the file. (That is, the 
               initial address of the next array to be added 
               to the file.)  

               `free' is a DAF address; for compatiblity with
               SPICELIB, the range of DAF addresses starts at 1.
 
-Parameters
 
   None. 
 
-Exceptions
 
   1) If the handle passed to this routine is not the handle of an 
      open DAF file, the error will be signaled by a routine called 
      by this routine. 
 
   2) If the specified DAF file is not open for read access, the 
      error will be diagnosed by a routine called by this routine. 
 
   3) If the specified record cannot (for some reason) be read, 
      the error SPICE(DAFFRNOTFOUND) is signaled. 
 
-Files
 
   The input `handle' should refer to a DAF file open for read
   or write access.
 
-Particulars
 
   The file record of a DAF is the only record that contains 
   any global information about the file. This record is created 
   when the file is created, and is updated only when new arrays 
   are added. 
 
   Like character records, file records are not buffered. 
 
-Examples
 
   In the following example, the file record of a DAF is read
   to determine the first free address in the file.
 
      #include <stdio.h>
      #include "SpiceUsr.h"

      int main ()
         {
         #define IFNLEN   61

         SpiceChar               ifname[IFNLEN];

         SpiceInt                bward;
         SpiceInt                free;
         SpiceInt                fward;
         SpiceInt                handle;
         SpiceInt                nd;
         SpiceInt                ni;
         SpiceChar             * kernel = "/kernels/gen/spk/de421.bsp";

         dafopr_c ( kernel, &handle );

         dafrfr_c ( handle, IFNLEN, &nd, &ni, ifname, &fward, &bward, &free );

         printf ( "First free DAF address is %d.\n", (int)free );
 
        /.
         Safely close the DAF.
         ./
         dafcls_c ( handle  );

         return ( 0 );
         }

   The program outputs:
   
      First free DAF address is 2098645.
