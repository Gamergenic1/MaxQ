/* $ Detailed_Input */

/*     TARG        is the NAIF ID code for a target body. The target */
/*                 and observer define a state vector whose position */
/*                 component points from the observer to the target. */

/*     ET          is the ephemeris time, expressed as seconds past J2000 */
/*                 TDB, at which the state of the target body relative to */
/*                 the observer is to be computed. ET refers to time at */
/*                 the observer's location. */

/*     REF         is the name of the reference frame relative to which */
/*                 the output state vector should be expressed. This may */
/*                 be any frame supported by the SPICE system, including */
/*                 built-in frames (documented in the Frames Required */
/*                 Reading) and frames defined by a loaded frame kernel */
/*                 (FK). */

/*                 When REF designates a non-inertial frame, the */
/*                 orientation of the frame is evaluated at an epoch */
/*                 dependent on the selected aberration correction. */
/*                 See the description of the output state vector STARG */
/*                 for details. */

/*     ABCORR      indicates the aberration corrections to be applied */
/*                 to the state of the target body to account for one-way */
/*                 light time and stellar aberration. See the discussion */
/*                 in the Particulars section for recommendations on */
/*                 how to choose aberration corrections. */

/*                 ABCORR may be any of the following: */

/*                    'NONE'     Apply no correction. Return the */

/*                               relative to the observer. */

/*                 The following values of ABCORR apply to the */
/*                 "reception" case in which photons depart from the */
/*                 target's location at the light-time corrected epoch */
/*                 ET-LT and *arrive* at the observer's location at ET: */

/*                    'LT'       Correct for one-way light time (also */
/*                               called "planetary aberration") using a */
/*                               Newtonian formulation. This correction */
/*                               yields the state of the target at the */
/*                               moment it emitted photons arriving at */
/*                               the observer at ET. */

/*                               The light time correction uses an */
/*                               iterative solution of the light time */

/*                               formulation. This option modifies the */
/*                               state obtained with the 'LT' option to */
/*                               account for the observer's velocity */

/*                               until the solution converges (three */

/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*     STARG       is a Cartesian state vector representing the position */
/*                 and velocity of the target body relative to the */
/*                 specified observer. STARG is corrected for the */
/*                 specified aberrations, and is expressed with respect */
/*                 to the reference frame specified by REF. The first */
/*                 three components of STARG represent the x-, y- and */
/*                 z-components of the target's position; the last three */
/*                 components form the corresponding velocity vector. */

/*                 The position component of STARG points from the */
/*                 observer's location at ET to the aberration-corrected */
/*                 location of the target. Note that the sense of the */
/*                 position vector is independent of the direction of */
/*                 radiation travel implied by the aberration */
/*                 correction. */

/*                 The velocity component of STARG is the derivative */

/*                 Units are always km and km/sec. */

/*                 Non-inertial frames are treated as follows: letting */

/*                 LTCENT is computed using the method indicated by */
/*                 ABCORR. */

/*     LT          is the one-way light time between the observer and */
/*                 target in seconds. If the target state is corrected */
/*                 for aberrations, then LT is the one-way light time */

/*     Aberration corrections */
/*     ====================== */

/*     In space science or engineering applications one frequently */
/*     wishes to know where to point a remote sensing instrument, such */
/*     as an optical camera or radio antenna, in order to observe or */
/*     otherwise receive radiation from a target. This pointing problem */
/*     is complicated by the finite speed of light:  one needs to point */
/*     to where the target appears to be as opposed to where it actually */
/*     is at the epoch of observation. We use the adjectives */
/*     "geometric," "uncorrected," or "true" to refer to an actual */
/*     position or state of a target at a specified epoch. When a */
/*     geometric position or state vector is modified to reflect how it */
/*     appears to an observer, we describe that vector by any of the */
/*     terms "apparent," "corrected," "aberration corrected," or "light */
/*     time and stellar aberration corrected." The SPICE Toolkit can */
/*     correct for two phenomena affecting the apparent location of an */
/*     object:  one-way light time (also called "planetary aberration") */
/*     and stellar aberration. */

/*     One-way light time */
/*     ------------------ */

/*     Correcting for one-way light time is done by computing, given an */
/*     observer and observation epoch, where a target was when the */
/*     observed photons departed the target's location. The vector from */
/*     the observer to this computed target location is called a "light */
/*     time corrected" vector. The light time correction depends on the */
/*     motion of the target relative to the solar system barycenter, but */
/*     it is independent of the velocity of the observer relative to the */
/*     solar system barycenter. Relativistic effects such as light */
/*     bending and gravitational delay are not accounted for in the */
/*     light time correction performed by this routine. */

/*     Stellar aberration */
/*     ------------------ */

/*     The velocity of the observer also affects the apparent location */
/*     of a target:  photons arriving at the observer are subject to a */
/*     "raindrop effect" whereby their velocity relative to the observer */
/*     is, using a Newtonian approximation, the photons' velocity */
/*     relative to the solar system barycenter minus the velocity of the */
/*     observer relative to the solar system barycenter. This effect is */
/*     called "stellar aberration."  Stellar aberration is independent */
/*     of the velocity of the target. The stellar aberration formula */
/*     used by this routine does not include (the much smaller) */
/*     relativistic effects. */

/*     Stellar aberration corrections are applied after light time */
/*     corrections:  the light time corrected target position vector is */
/*     used as an input to the stellar aberration correction. */

/*     When light time and stellar aberration corrections are both */
/*     applied to a geometric position vector, the resulting position */
/*     vector indicates where the target "appears to be" from the */
/*     observer's location. */

/*     As opposed to computing the apparent position of a target, one */
/*     may wish to compute the pointing direction required for */
/*     transmission of photons to the target. This also requires */
/*     correction of the geometric target position for the effects of */
/*     light time and stellar aberration, but in this case the */
/*     corrections are computed for radiation traveling *from* the */
/*     observer to the target. */

/*     The "transmission" light time correction yields the target's */
/*     location as it will be when photons emitted from the observer's */
/*     location at ET arrive at the target. The transmission stellar */
/*     aberration correction is the inverse of the traditional stellar */
/*     aberration correction:  it indicates the direction in which */
/*     radiation should be emitted so that, using a Newtonian */
/*     approximation, the sum of the velocity of the radiation relative */
/*     to the observer and of the observer's velocity, relative to the */
/*     solar system barycenter, yields a velocity vector that points in */
/*     the direction of the light time corrected position of the target. */

/*     One may object to using the term "observer" in the transmission */
/*     case, in which radiation is emitted from the observer's location. */
/*     The terminology was retained for consistency with earlier */
/*     documentation. */

/*     Below, we indicate the aberration corrections to use for some */
/*     common applications: */


/*        1) Find the apparent direction of a target for a remote-sensing */
/*           observation. */

/*              Use 'LT+S' or 'CN+S: apply both light time and stellar */
/*              aberration corrections. */

/*           Note that using light time corrections alone ('LT' or 'CN') */
/*           is generally not a good way to obtain an approximation to */
/*           an apparent target vector: since light time and stellar */
/*           aberration corrections often partially cancel each other, */
/*           it may be more accurate to use no correction at all than to */
/*           use light time alone. */


/*        2) Find the corrected pointing direction to radiate a signal */
/*           to a target. This computation is often applicable for */
/*           implementing communications sessions. */

/*              Use 'XLT+S' or 'XCN+S: apply both light time and stellar */
/*              aberration corrections for transmission. */


/*        3) Compute the apparent position of a target body relative */
/*           to a star or other distant object. */

/*              Use 'LT', 'CN', 'LT+S', or 'CN+S' as needed to match the */
/*              correction applied to the position of the distant */
/*              object. For example, if a star position is obtained from */
/*              a catalog, the position vector may not be corrected for */
/*              stellar aberration. In this case, to find the angular */
/*              separation of the star and the limb of a planet, the */
/*              vector from the observer to the planet should be */
/*              corrected for light time but not stellar aberration. */


/*        4) Obtain an uncorrected state vector derived directly from */
/*           data in an SPK file. */

/*              Use 'NONE'. */


/*        5) Use a geometric state vector as a low-accuracy estimate */
/*           of the apparent state for an application where execution */
/*           speed is critical. */

/*              Use 'NONE'. */


/*        6) While this routine cannot perform the relativistic */
/*           aberration corrections required to compute states */
/*           with the highest possible accuracy, it can supply the */
/*           geometric states required as inputs to these computations. */

/*              Use 'NONE', then apply relativistic aberration */
/*              corrections (not available in the SPICE Toolkit). */


/*     Below, we discuss in more detail how the aberration corrections */
/*     applied by this routine are computed. */

/*        Geometric case */
/*        ============== */

/*        SPKEZ begins by computing the geometric position T(ET) of the */
/*        target body relative to the solar system barycenter (SSB). */
/*        Subtracting the geometric position of the observer O(ET) gives */
/*        the geometric position of the target body relative to the */
/*        observer. The one-way light time, LT, is given by */

/*                  | T(ET) - O(ET) | */
/*           LT = ------------------- */
/*                          c */

/*        The geometric relationship between the observer, target, and */
/*        solar system barycenter is as shown: */


/*           SSB ---> O(ET) */
/*            |      / */
/*            |     / */
/*            |    / */
/*            |   /  T(ET) - O(ET) */
/*            V  V */
/*           T(ET) */


/*        The returned state consists of the position vector */

/*           T(ET) - O(ET) */

/*        and a velocity obtained by taking the difference of the */
/*        corresponding velocities. In the geometric case, the */
/*        returned velocity is actually the time derivative of the */
/*        position. */


/*        Reception case */
/*        ============== */

/*        When any of the options 'LT', 'CN', 'LT+S', 'CN+S' is selected */
/*        for ABCORR, SPKEZ computes the position of the target body at */
/*        epoch ET-LT, where LT is the one-way light time. Let T(t) and */
/*        O(t) represent the positions of the target and observer */
/*        relative to the solar system barycenter at time t; then LT is */
/*        the solution of the light-time equation */

/*                  | T(ET-LT) - O(ET) | */
/*           LT = ------------------------                            (1) */
/*                           c */

/*        The ratio */

/*            | T(ET) - O(ET) | */
/*          ---------------------                                     (2) */
/*                    c */

/*        is used as a first approximation to LT; inserting (2) into the */
/*        right hand side of the light-time equation (1) yields the */
/*        "one-iteration" estimate of the one-way light time ("LT"). */
/*        Repeating the process until the estimates of LT converge */
/*        yields the "converged Newtonian" light time estimate ("CN"). */

/*        Subtracting the geometric position of the observer O(ET) gives */
/*        the position of the target body relative to the observer: */
/*        T(ET-LT) - O(ET). */

/*           SSB ---> O(ET) */
/*            | \     | */
/*            |  \    | */
/*            |   \   | T(ET-LT) - O(ET) */
/*            |    \  | */
/*            V     V V */
/*           T(ET)  T(ET-LT) */

/*        The position component of the light time corrected state */
/*        is the vector */

/*           T(ET-LT) - O(ET) */

/*        The velocity component of the light time corrected state */
/*        is the difference */

/*           T_vel(ET-LT)*(1-dLT/dET) - O_vel(ET) */

/*        where T_vel and O_vel are, respectively, the velocities of the */
/*        target and observer relative to the solar system barycenter at */
/*        the epochs ET-LT and ET. */

/*        If correction for stellar aberration is requested, the target */
/*        position is rotated toward the solar system barycenter- */
/*        relative velocity vector of the observer. The rotation is */
/*        computed as follows: */

/*           Let r be the light time corrected vector from the observer */
/*           to the object, and v be the velocity of the observer with */
/*           respect to the solar system barycenter. Let w be the angle */
/*           between them. The aberration angle phi is given by */

/*              sin(phi) = v sin(w) / c */

/*           Let h be the vector given by the cross product */

/*              h = r X v */

/*           Rotate r by phi radians about h to obtain the apparent */
/*           position of the object. */

/*        When stellar aberration corrections are used, the rate of */
/*        change of the stellar aberration correction is accounted for */
/*        in the computation of the output velocity. */


/*        Transmission case */
/*        ================== */

/*        When any of the options 'XLT', 'XCN', 'XLT+S', 'XCN+S' is */
/*        selected, SPKEZ computes the position of the target body T at */
/*        epoch ET+LT, where LT is the one-way light time. LT is the */
/*        solution of the light-time equation */

/*                  | T(ET+LT) - O(ET) | */
/*           LT = ------------------------                            (3) */
/*                            c */

/*        Subtracting the geometric position of the observer, O(ET), */
/*        gives the position of the target body relative to the */
/*        observer: T(ET-LT) - O(ET). */

/*                   SSB --> O(ET) */
/*                  / |    * */
/*                 /  |  *  T(ET+LT) - O(ET) */
/*                /   |* */
/*               /   *| */
/*              V  V  V */
/*          T(ET+LT)  T(ET) */

/*        The position component of the light-time corrected state */
/*        is the vector */

/*           T(ET+LT) - O(ET) */

/*        The velocity component of the light-time corrected state */
/*        consists of the difference */

/*           T_vel(ET+LT)*(1+dLT/dET) - O_vel(ET) */

/*        where T_vel and O_vel are, respectively, the velocities of the */
/*        target and observer relative to the solar system barycenter at */
/*        the epochs ET+LT and ET. */

/*        If correction for stellar aberration is requested, the target */
/*        position is rotated away from the solar system barycenter- */
/*        relative velocity vector of the observer. The rotation is */
/*        computed as in the reception case, but the sign of the */
/*        rotation angle is negated. Velocities are adjusted to account */
/*        for the rate of change of the stellar aberration correction. */


/*     Precision of light time corrections */
/*     =================================== */

/*        Corrections using one iteration of the light time solution */
/*        ---------------------------------------------------------- */

/*        When the requested aberration correction is 'LT', 'LT+S', */
/*        'XLT', or 'XLT+S', only one iteration is performed in the */
/*        algorithm used to compute LT. */

/*        The relative error in this computation */

/*           | LT_ACTUAL - LT_COMPUTED |  /  LT_ACTUAL */

/*        is at most */

/*            (V/C)**2 */
/*           ---------- */
/*            1 - (V/C) */

/*        which is well approximated by (V/C)**2, where V is the */
/*        velocity of the target relative to an inertial frame and C is */
/*        the speed of light. */

/*        For nearly all objects in the solar system V is less than 60 */
/*        km/sec. The value of C is ~300000 km/sec. Thus the */
/*        one-iteration solution for LT has a potential relative error */
/*        of not more than 4e-8. This is a potential light time error of */
/*        approximately 2e-5 seconds per astronomical unit of distance */
/*        separating the observer and target. Given the bound on V cited */
/*        above: */

/*           As long as the observer and target are separated by less */
/*           than 50 astronomical units, the error in the light time */
/*           returned using the one-iteration light time corrections is */
/*           less than 1 millisecond. */

/*           The magnitude of the corresponding position error, given */
/*           the above assumptions, may be as large as (V/C)**2 * the */
/*           distance between the observer and the uncorrected target */
/*           position: 300 km or equivalently 6 km/AU. */

/*        In practice, the difference between positions obtained using */
/*        one-iteration and converged light time is usually much smaller */
/*        than the value computed above and can be insignificant. For */
/*        example, for the spacecraft Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and */
/*        Mars Express, the position error for the one-iteration light */
/*        time correction, applied to the spacecraft-to-Mars center */
/*        vector, is at the 1 cm level. */

/*        Comparison of results obtained using the one-iteration and */
/*        converged light time solutions is recommended when adequacy of */
/*        the one-iteration solution is in doubt. */


/*        Converged corrections */
/*        --------------------- */

/*        When the requested aberration correction is 'CN', 'CN+S', */
/*        'XCN', or 'XCN+S', as many iterations as are required for */
/*        convergence are performed in the computation of LT. Usually */
/*        the solution is found after three iterations. The relative */
/*        error present in this case is at most */

/*            (V/C)**4 */
/*           ---------- */
/*            1 - (V/C) */

/*        which is well approximated by (V/C)**4. */

/*           The precision of this computation (ignoring round-off */
/*           error) is better than 4e-11 seconds for any pair of objects */
/*           less than 50 AU apart, and having speed relative to the */
/*           solar system barycenter less than 60 km/s. */

/*           The magnitude of the corresponding position error, given */
/*           the above assumptions, may be as large as (V/C)**4 * the */
/*           distance between the observer and the uncorrected target */
/*           position: 1.2 cm at 50 AU or equivalently 0.24 mm/AU. */

/*        However, to very accurately model the light time between */
/*        target and observer one must take into account effects due to */
/*        general relativity. These may be as high as a few hundredths */
/*        of a millisecond for some objects. */


/*     Relativistic Corrections */
/*     ========================= */

/*     This routine does not attempt to perform either general or */
/*     special relativistic corrections in computing the various */
/*     aberration corrections. For many applications relativistic */
/*     corrections are not worth the expense of added computation */
/*     cycles. If however, your application requires these additional */
/*     corrections we suggest you consult the astronomical almanac (page */
/*     B36) for a discussion of how to carry out these corrections. */

/*        Routine was upgraded to more accurately compute aberration- */
/*        corrected velocity, and in particular, make it more consistent */
/*        with observer-target positions. When light time corrections */
/*        are used: */

/*        When stellar aberration corrections are used, velocities */
/*        now reflect the rate of range of the stellar aberration */
/*        correction. */

/*        This routine was modified as follows: */

/*           - SPKAPP is no longer called; it has been superseded */
/*             by SPKACS. Aberration-corrected states relative to */
/*             inertial frames are computed by SPKACS. */

/*           - The effect of the rate of change of light time on the */
/*             rate of change of orientation of non-inertial output */
/*             frames is accounted for in this routine. See the code */
/*             near the end of this source file. */

/*        The header of this routine has been updated to reflect the */
/*        upgrades described here. */

/*        As a separate upgrade, the method by which the aberration */
/*        correction flag is parsed has been made more robust: parsing */
/*        is now done by the routine ZZZPRSCOR. The new parsing */
/*        technique calls for parsing the input string only when it */
/*        differs from the previous value. */

/*        The routine was upgraded so that it can now support */
/*        non-inertial reference frames. In additions some */
/*        of the error messages were slightly enhanced. */

/* -    SPICELIB Version 2.1.1, 5-AUG-1994 (HAN) (MJS) */

/*        Added code so that routine accepts lower case, mixed case */

/* -    SPICELIB Version 2.0.0, 18-JUL-1991 (JEM) (NJB) */

/*        The previous version of SPKEZ could not */
/*        compute the geometric state (no aberration */
/*        correction) of one body with respect to */
/*        another if the ephemeris data for each */
/*        body relative to the Solar System Barycenter */
/*        (body 0) had not been loaded. Now, if */
/*        sufficient data is loaded, SPKEZ can always */
/*        compute the state. */

/*        For example, suppose the file GLL.BSP contains */
/*        segments of SPK data for the Galileo spacecraft */
/*        (body -77) relative to the Jupiter Barycenter */
/*        (body 5) over a period of time. If SPKEZ Version */
/*        1.0.0 was called to compute the geometric state of */
/*        -77 relative to 5 (or vice versa), a routine that */
/*        SPKEZ calls, SPKSSB, would signal an error stating */
/*        that there is insufficient data for computing the */
/*        state of body 5 (relative to 0). Version 1.0.0 */
/*        of SPKEZ could not compute the requested state even */
/*        though sufficient data had been loaded. */

/*        It is necessary to compute the states of each */
/*        of the target and observing bodies relative to */
/*        the solar system barycenter when aberration */
/*        corrections are being applied. However, when */
/*        computing geometric states, it is only necessary */
/*        to trace back to the first common node. Positive */
/*        side effects include the maintenance of precision */
/*        and reduction in number of look ups. */

/*        The changes to the code in SPKEZ involved calling a new */
/*        routine, SPKGEO, which computes the geometric state if */
/*        no aberration corrections are requested. */

/*        The other cosmetic changes include the removal of a reference */
/*        to the SPK User's Guide in Literature_References because */
/*        the User's Guide is the same as SPK Required Reading. */

/*        Also, the item in Restrictions previously said */

/*           1) The ephemeris files to be used by SPKEZ must be loaded */
/*              by SPKLEF before SPKSSB is called. */

/*        SPKSSB was replaced with SPKEZ. */

/*        The location of the position and velocity information in the */
/*        output state vector argument STARG is now spelled out. */

/*        Finally, the Particulars section was updated. In Version */
/*        1.0.0 it said that calling SPKEZ was equivalent to calling */
