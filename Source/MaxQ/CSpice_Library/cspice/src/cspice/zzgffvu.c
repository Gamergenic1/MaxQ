/*          Data defining the reference frame associated with the */

/*          a frame kernel via FURNSH. */

/*        - IK data: the kernel pool must contain data such that */
/*          the SPICELIB routine GETFOV may be called to obtain */
/*          parameters for INST. Normally such data are provided by */
/*          an IK via FURNSH. */

/*     The following data may be required: */

/*        - PCK data: bodies modeled as triaxial ellipsoids must have */
/*          orientation data provided by variables in the kernel pool. */
/*          Typically these data are made available by loading a text */
/*          PCK file via FURNSH. */

/*          Bodies modeled as triaxial ellipsoids must have semi-axis */

/*          these data are made available by loading a text PCK file via */
/*          FURNSH. */

/*        - CK data: if the instrument frame is fixed to a spacecraft, */
/*          at least one CK file will be needed to permit transformation */
/*          of vectors between that frame and both J2000 and the target */
/*          body-fixed frame. */

/*        - SCLK data:  if a CK file is needed, an associated SCLK */
/*          kernel is required to enable conversion between encoded SCLK */
/*          (used to time-tag CK data) and barycentric dynamical time */
/*          (TDB). */

/*     Kernel data are normally loaded once per program run, NOT every */

/*                (FOV) of which is to be used for a target intersection */
/*                search: times when the specified target intersects the */
/*                region of space corresponding to the FOV are sought. */

/*                The position of the instrument designated by INST is */
/*                considered to coincide with that of the ephemeris */
/*                object designated by the input argument OBSRVR (see */
/*                description below). */

/*                INST must have a corresponding NAIF ID and a frame */
/*                defined, as is normally done in a frame kernel. It */
/*                must also have an associated reference frame and a FOV */
/*                shape, boresight and boundary vertices (or reference */
/*                vector and reference angles) defined, as is usually */
/*                done in an instrument kernel. */

/*                See the header of the SPICELIB routine GETFOV for a */

/*     TSHAPE     is a string indicating the geometric model used to */

/*                The target body may be represented by either an */

/*                The supported values of TSHAPE are: */

/*     RAYDIR     is the direction vector associated with a ray */

/*                Optionally, you may supply the integer NAIF ID code */

/*     TFRAME     is the name of the reference frame associated with the */

/*                (for Saturn) and 'ITRF93' (for the Earth). */

/*                If the target is an ephemeris object modeled as an */

/*                If the target is an ephemeris object modeled as a */

/*                If the target is modeled as a ray, TFRAME may */

/*                position of the frame center. */

/*                Case and leading or trailing blanks bracketing a */
