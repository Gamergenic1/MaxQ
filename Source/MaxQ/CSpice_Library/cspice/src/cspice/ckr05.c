/*     3) If the input SCLK value is not within the range specified */
/*        in the segment descriptor, the error SPICE(TIMEOUTOFBOUNDS) */
/*        is signaled. */

/*     4) If the window size is non-positive or greater than the */
/*        maximum allowed value, the error SPICE(INVALIDVALUE) is */
/*        signaled. */

/*     5) If the window size is not compatible with the segment */
/*        subtype, the error SPICE(INVALIDVALUE) is signaled. */

/*     6) If the segment subtype is not recognized, the error */
/*        SPICE(NOTSUPPORTED) is signaled. */
