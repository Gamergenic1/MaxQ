/* $ Parameters */

/*     None. */

/* $ Exceptions */


/*     1)  If the specified aberration correction is unrecognized, the */
/*         error will be diagnosed and signaled by a routine in the call */
/*         tree of this routine. */

/*     2)  If either the target or observer input strings cannot be */
/*         converted to an integer ID code, the error will be signaled */
/*         by a routine in the call tree of this routine. */

/*     3)  If OBSRVR and TARGET map to the same NAIF integer ID code, */
/*         the error will be signaled by a routine in the call tree of */
/*         this routine. */

/*     4)  If the input target body-fixed frame FIXREF is not */
/*         recognized, the error will be signaled by a routine in the */
/*         call tree of this routine. A frame name may fail to be */
/*         recognized because a required frame specification kernel has */
/*         not been loaded; another cause is a misspelling of the frame */
/*         name. */

/*     5)  If the input frame FIXREF is not centered at the target body, */
/*         the error will be signaled by a routine in the call tree of */
/*         this routine. */

/*     6)  If the input argument METHOD is not recognized, the error */
/*         will be signaled by a routine in the call tree of this */
/*         routine. */

/*     7)  If insufficient ephemeris data have been loaded prior to */
/*         calling ILUMIN, the error will be diagnosed and signaled by a */
/*         routine in the call tree of this routine. Note that when */
/*         light time correction is used, sufficient ephemeris data must */
/*         be available to propagate the states of observer, target, and */
/*         the Sun to the solar system barycenter. */

/*     8)  If the computation method specifies an ellipsoidal target */
/*         shape and triaxial radii of the target body have not been */
/*         loaded into the kernel pool prior to calling ILUMIN, the */
/*         error will be diagnosed and signaled by a routine in the call */
/*         tree of this routine. */

/*     9)  The target must be an extended body: if any of the radii of */
/*         the target body are non-positive, the error will be */
/*         diagnosed and signaled by routines in the call tree of this */
/*         routine. */

/*     10) If PCK data specifying the target body-fixed frame */
/*         orientation have not been loaded prior to calling ILUMIN, */
/*         the error will be diagnosed and signaled by a routine in the */
/*         call tree of this routine. */

/*     11) If METHOD specifies that the target surface is represented by */
/*         DSK data, and no DSK files are loaded for the specified */
/*         target, the error is signaled by a routine in the call tree */
/*         of this routine. */

/*     12) If METHOD specifies that the target surface is represented */
/*         by DSK data, and data representing the portion of the surface */
/*         on which SPOINT is located are not available, an error will */
/*         be signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine. */

/*     13) If METHOD specifies that the target surface is represented */
/*         by DSK data, SPOINT must lie on the target surface, not above */
/*         or below it. A small tolerance is used to allow for round-off */
/*         error in the calculation determining whether SPOINT is on the */
/*         surface. If, in the DSK case, SPOINT is too far from the */
/*         surface, an error will be signaled by a routine in the call */
/*         tree of this routine. */

/*         If the surface is represented by a triaxial ellipsoid, SPOINT */
/*         is not required to be close to the ellipsoid; however, the */
/*         results computed by this routine will be unreliable if SPOINT */
/*         is too far from the ellipsoid. */

/* $ Files */


/*     Appropriate kernels must be loaded by the calling program before */
/*     this routine is called. */

/*     The following data are required: */

/*        - SPK data: ephemeris data for target, observer, and the */
/*          illumination source must be loaded. If aberration */
/*          corrections are used, the states of target, observer, and */
/*          the illumination source relative to the solar system */
/*          barycenter must be calculable from the available ephemeris */
/*          data. Typically ephemeris data are made available by loading */
/*          one or more SPK files via FURNSH. */

/*        - PCK data: rotation data for the target body must be */
/*          loaded. These may be provided in a text or binary PCK file. */

/*        - Shape data for the target body: */

/*            PCK data: */

/*               If the target body shape is modeled as an ellipsoid, */
/*               triaxial radii for the target body must be loaded into */
/*               the kernel pool. Typically this is done by loading a */
/*               text PCK file via FURNSH. */

/*               Triaxial radii are also needed if the target shape is */
/*               modeled by DSK data, but the DSK NADIR method is */
/*               selected. */

/*            DSK data: */

/*               If the target shape is modeled by DSK data, DSK files */
/*               containing topographic data for the target body must be */
/*               loaded. If a surface list is specified, data for at */
/*               least one of the listed surfaces must be loaded. */

/*     The following data may be required: */

/*        - Frame data: if a frame definition is required to convert the */
/*          observer and target states to the body-fixed frame of the */
/*          target, that definition must be available in the kernel */
/*          pool. Typically the definition is supplied by loading a */
/*          frame kernel via FURNSH. */

/*        - Surface name-ID associations: if surface names are specified */
/*          in METHOD, the association of these names with their */
/*          corresponding surface ID codes must be established by */
/*          assignments of the kernel variables */

/*             NAIF_SURFACE_NAME */
/*             NAIF_SURFACE_CODE */
/*             NAIF_SURFACE_BODY */

/*          Normally these associations are made by loading a text */
/*          kernel containing the necessary assignments. An example */
/*          of such an assignment is */

/*             NAIF_SURFACE_NAME += 'Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG' */
/*             NAIF_SURFACE_CODE += 1 */
/*             NAIF_SURFACE_BODY += 499 */

/*     In all cases, kernel data are normally loaded once per program */
/*     run, NOT every time this routine is called. */


/* $ Particulars */


/*     SPICELIB contains four routines that compute illumination angles: */

/*        ILLUMF (same as ILLUMG, except that illumination */
/*                and visibility flags are returned.) */

/*        ILLUMG (same as ILUMIN, except that the caller */
/*                specifies the illumination source.) */

/*        ILUMIN (this routine) */

/*        ILLUM  (deprecated) */

/*     ILLUMF is the most capable of the set. */


/*     Illumination angles */
/*     =================== */

/*     The term "illumination angles" refers to the following set of */
/*     angles: */


/*        phase angle              Angle between the vectors from the */
/*                                 surface point to the observer and */
/*                                 from the surface point to the Sun. */

/*        solar incidence angle    Angle between the surface normal at */
/*                                 the specified surface point and the */
/*                                 vector from the surface point to the */
/*                                 Sun. */

/*        emission angle           Angle between the surface normal at */
/*                                 the specified surface point and the */

/*                                 observer. */

/*     The diagram below illustrates the geometric relationships */
/*     defining these angles. The labels for the solar incidence, */
/*     emission, and phase angles are "s.i.", "e.", and "phase". */

/*      (observer)         location */


/*     Note that if the target-observer vector, the target normal vector */
/*     at the surface point, and the target-sun vector are coplanar, */
/*     then phase is the sum of incidence and emission. This is rarely */
/*     true; usually */

/*        phase angle  <  solar incidence angle + emission angle */

/*     All of the above angles can be computed using light time */
/*     corrections, light time and stellar aberration corrections, or */
/*     no aberration corrections. In order to describe apparent */
/*     geometry as observed by a remote sensing instrument, both */
/*     light time and stellar aberration corrections should be used. */

/*     The way aberration corrections are applied by this routine */
/*     is described below. */

/*        Light time corrections */
/*        ====================== */

/*           Observer-target surface point vector */
/*           ------------------------------------ */

/*           Let ET be the epoch at which an observation or remote */
/*           sensing measurement is made, and let ET - LT ("LT" stands */
/*           for "light time") be the epoch at which the photons */
/*           received at ET were emitted from the surface point SPOINT. */
/*           Note that the light time between the surface point and */
/*           observer will generally differ from the light time between */
/*           the target body's center and the observer. */


/*           Target body's orientation */
/*           ------------------------- */

/*           Using the definitions of ET and LT above, the target body's */
/*           orientation at ET - LT is used. The surface normal is */
/*           dependent on the target body's orientation, so the body's */
/*           orientation model must be evaluated for the correct epoch. */


/*           Target body -- Sun vector */
/*           ------------------------- */

/*           The surface features on the target body near SPOINT will */
/*           appear in a measurement made at ET as they were at ET-LT. */
/*           In particular, lighting on the target body is dependent on */
/*           the apparent location of the Sun as seen from the target */
/*           body at ET-LT. So, a second light time correction is used */
/*           to compute the position of the Sun relative to the surface */
/*           point. */


/*        Stellar aberration corrections */
/*        ============================== */

/*        Stellar aberration corrections are applied only if */
/*        light time corrections are applied as well. */

/*           Observer-target surface point body vector */
/*           ----------------------------------------- */

/*           When stellar aberration correction is performed, the */
/*           direction vector SRFVEC is adjusted so as to point to the */
/*           apparent position of SPOINT: considering SPOINT to be an */
/*           ephemeris object, SRFVEC points from the observer's */
/*           position at ET to the light time and stellar aberration */
/*           corrected position of SPOINT. */

/*           Target body-Sun vector */
/*           ---------------------- */

/*           The target body-Sun vector is the apparent position of the */
/*           Sun, corrected for light time and stellar aberration, as */
/*           seen from the target body at time ET-LT. */


/*     Using DSK data */
/*     ============== */

/*        DSK loading and unloading */
/*        ------------------------- */

/*        DSK files providing data used by this routine are loaded by */
/*        calling FURNSH and can be unloaded by calling UNLOAD or */
/*        KCLEAR. See the documentation of FURNSH for limits on numbers */
/*        of loaded DSK files. */

/*        For run-time efficiency, it's desirable to avoid frequent */
/*        loading and unloading of DSK files. When there is a reason to */
/*        use multiple versions of data for a given target body---for */
/*        example, if topographic data at varying resolutions are to be */
/*        used---the surface list can be used to select DSK data to be */
/*        used for a given computation. It is not necessary to unload */
/*        the data that are not to be used. This recommendation presumes */
/*        that DSKs containing different versions of surface data for a */
/*        given body have different surface ID codes. */


/*        DSK data priority */
/*        ----------------- */

/*        A DSK coverage overlap occurs when two segments in loaded DSK */
/*        files cover part or all of the same domain---for example, a */
/*        given longitude-latitude rectangle---and when the time */
/*        intervals of the segments overlap as well. */

/*        When DSK data selection is prioritized, in case of a coverage */
/*        overlap, if the two competing segments are in different DSK */
/*        files, the segment in the DSK file loaded last takes */
/*        precedence. If the two segments are in the same file, the */
/*        segment located closer to the end of the file takes */
/*        precedence. */

/*        When DSK data selection is unprioritized, data from competing */
/*        segments are combined. For example, if two competing segments */
/*        both represent a surface as sets of triangular plates, the */
/*        union of those sets of plates is considered to represent the */
/*        surface. */

/*        Currently only unprioritized data selection is supported. */
/*        Because prioritized data selection may be the default behavior */
/*        in a later version of the routine, the UNPRIORITIZED keyword is */
/*        required in the METHOD argument. */


/*        Syntax of the METHOD input argument */
/*        ----------------------------------- */

/*        The keywords and surface list in the METHOD argument */
/*        are called "clauses." The clauses may appear in any */
/*        order, for example */

/*           DSK/<surface list>/UNPRIORITIZED */
/*           DSK/UNPRIORITIZED/<surface list> */
/*           UNPRIORITIZED/<surface list>/DSK */

/*        The simplest form of the METHOD argument specifying use of */
/*        DSK data is one that lacks a surface list, for example: */

/*           'DSK/UNPRIORITIZED' */

/*        For applications in which all loaded DSK data for the target */
/*        body are for a single surface, and there are no competing */
/*        segments, the above string suffices. This is expected to be */
/*        the usual case. */

/*        When, for the specified target body, there are loaded DSK */
/*        files providing data for multiple surfaces for that body, the */
/*        surfaces to be used by this routine for a given call must be */
/*        specified in a surface list, unless data from all of the */
/*        surfaces are to be used together. */

/*        The surface list consists of the string */

/*           SURFACES = */

/*        followed by a comma-separated list of one or more surface */
/*        identifiers. The identifiers may be names or integer codes in */
/*        string format. For example, suppose we have the surface */
/*        names and corresponding ID codes shown below: */

/*           Surface Name                              ID code */
/*           ------------                              ------- */
/*           'Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG'                1 */
/*           'Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG'                 2 */
/*           'Mars_MRO_HIRISE'                         3 */

/*        If data for all of the above surfaces are loaded, then */
/*        data for surface 1 can be specified by either */

/*           'SURFACES = 1' */

/*        or */

/*           'SURFACES = "Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG"' */

/*        Double quotes are used to delimit the surface name because */
/*        it contains blank characters. */

/*        To use data for surfaces 2 and 3 together, any */
/*        of the following surface lists could be used: */

/*           'SURFACES = 2, 3' */

/*           'SURFACES = "Mars MEGDR  64 PIXEL/DEG", 3' */

/*           'SURFACES = 2, Mars_MRO_HIRISE' */

/*           'SURFACES = "Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG", Mars_MRO_HIRISE' */

/*        An example of a METHOD argument that could be constructed */
/*        using one of the surface lists above is */

/*              'DSK/UNPRIORITIZED/SURFACES = ' */
/*           // '"Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG", 3' */


/*        Aberration corrections using DSK data */
/*        ------------------------------------- */

/*        For irregularly shaped target bodies, the distance between the */
/*        observer and the nearest surface intercept need not be a */
/*        continuous function of time; hence the one-way light time */
/*        between the intercept and the observer may be discontinuous as */
/*        well. In such cases, the computed light time, which is found */
/*        using an iterative algorithm, may converge slowly or not at */
/*        all. In all cases, the light time computation will terminate, */
/*        but the result may be less accurate than expected. */


/* $ Examples */

/*     The numerical results shown for this example may differ across */
/*     platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as */
/*     input, the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine */
/*     specific arithmetic implementation. */

/*     1) Find the phase, solar incidence, and emission angles at the */
/*        sub-solar and sub-spacecraft points on Mars as seen from the */
/*        Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft at a specified UTC time. Use */
/*        light time and stellar aberration corrections. */

/*        Use both an ellipsoidal Mars shape model and topographic data */
/*        provided by a DSK file. */
