/*     Note:  The column descriptor size parameter CDSCSZ  is */
/*     declared separately in the include section CDSIZE$INC.FOR. */

/*     Offset of column descriptors, relative to start of segment */
/*     integer address range.  This number, when added to the last */
/*     integer address preceding the segment, yields the DAS integer */
/*     base address of the first column descriptor.  Currently, this */
/*     offset is exactly the size of a segment descriptor.  The */
/*     parameter SDSCSZ, which defines the size of a segment descriptor, */
/*     is declared in the include file eksegdsc.inc. */


/*     Size of column descriptor */


/*     Indices of various pieces of column descriptors: */


/*     CLSIDX is the index of the column's class code.  (We use the */
/*     word `class' to distinguish this item from the column's data */
/*     type.) */


/*     TYPIDX is the index of the column's data type code (CHR, INT, DP, */
/*     or TIME).  The type is actually implied by the class, but it */
/*     will frequently be convenient to look up the type directly. */



/*     LENIDX is the index of the column's string length value, if the */
/*     column has character type.  A value of IFALSE in this element of */
/*     the descriptor indicates that the strings have variable length. */


/*     SIZIDX is the index of the column's element size value.  This */
/*     descriptor element is meaningful for columns with fixed-size */
/*     entries.  For variable-sized columns, this value is IFALSE. */


/*     NAMIDX is the index of the base address of the column's name. */


/*     IXTIDX is the data type of the column's index.  IXTIDX */
/*     contains a type value only if the column is indexed. For columns */
/*     that are not indexed, the location IXTIDX contains the boolean */
/*     value IFALSE. */


/*     IXPIDX is a pointer to the column's index.  IXTPDX contains a */
/*     meaningful value only if the column is indexed.  The */
/*     interpretation of the pointer depends on the data type of the */
/*     index. */


/*     NFLIDX is the index of a flag indicating whether nulls are */
/*     permitted in the column.  The value at location NFLIDX is */
/*     ITRUE if nulls are permitted and IFALSE otherwise. */


/*     ORDIDX is the index of the column's ordinal position in the */
/*     list of columns belonging to the column's parent segment. */


/*     METIDX is the index of the column's integer metadata pointer. */
/*     This pointer is a DAS integer address. */

/*     These files use a paged DAS file as their underlying file */
/*     structure. */

/*     In paged DAS EK files, data pages are structured:  they contain */

/*     few addresses of each page, so as to interfere as little as */
/*     possible with calculation of data addresses. */

/*     Each data page belongs to exactly one segment.  Some bookkeeping */
/*     information, such as record pointers, is also stored in data */
/*     pages. */

/*     Each page contains a forward pointer that allows rapid lookup */
/*     of data items that span multiple pages.  Each page also keeps */
/*     track of the current number of links from its parent segment */
/*     to the page.  Link counts enable pages to `know' when they */
/*     are no longer in use by a segment; unused pages are deallocated */
/*     and returned to the free list. */

/*     The parameters in this include file depend on the parameters */
/*     declared in the include file ekpage.inc.  If those parameters */
/*     change, this file must be updated.  The specified parameter */
/*     declarations we need from that file are: */

/*        ekrecptr.inc Version 2  18-JUL-1995 (NJB) */


/*     This file declares parameters used in EK record pointers. */
/*     Each segment references data in a given record via two levels */
/*     of indirection:  a record number points to a record pointer, */
/*     which is a structured array of metadata and data pointers. */

/*     Record pointers always occupy contiguous ranges of integer */
/*     addresses. */

/*     The parameter declarations in this file depend on the assumption */
/*     that integer pages contain 256 DAS integer words and that the */
/*     maximum number of columns in a segment is 100.  Record pointers */
/*     are stored in integer data pages, so they must fit within the */
/*     usable data area afforded by these pages.  The size of the usable */
/*     data area is given by the parameter IPSIZE which is declared in */
/*     ekdatpag.inc.  The assumed value of IPSIZE is 254. */


/*     The first element of each record pointer is a status indicator. */
/*     The meanings of status indicators depend on whether the parent EK */
/*     is shadowed or not.  For shadowed EKs, allowed status values and */
/*     their meanings are: */

/*        OLD       The record has not been modified since */
/*                  the EK containing the record was opened. */

/*        UPDATE    The record is an update of a previously existing */
/*                  record.  The original record is now on the */
/*                  modified record list. */

/*        NEW       The record has been added since the EK containing the */
/*                  record was opened.  The record is not an update */
/*                  of a previously existing record. */

/*        DELOLD    This status applies only to a backup record. */
/*                  DELOLD status indicates that the record corresponds */
/*                  to a deleted OLD record in the source segment. */

/*        DELNEW    This status applies only to a backup record. */
/*                  DELNEW status indicates that the record corresponds */
/*                  to a deleted NEW record in the source segment. */

/*        DELUPD    This status applies only to a backup record. */
/*                  DELUPD status indicates that the record corresponds */
/*                  to a deleted UPDATEd record in the source segment. */

/*     In EKs that are not shadowed, all records have status OLD. */



/*     The following parameters refer to indices within the record */
/*     pointer structure: */

/*     Index of status indicator: */


/*     Each record pointer contains a pointer to its companion:  for a */
/*     record belonging to a shadowed EK, this is the backup counterpart, */
/*     or if the parent EK is itself a backup EK, a pointer to the */
/*     record's source record.  The pointer is UNINIT (see below) if the */
/*     record is unmodified. */

/*     Record companion pointers contain record numbers, not record */
/*     base addresses. */

/*     Index of record's companion pointer: */


/*     Each data item is referenced by an integer.  The meaning of */
/*     this integer depends on the representation of data in the */
/*     column to which the data item belongs.  Actual lookup of a */
/*     data item must be done by subroutines appropriate to the class of */
/*     the column to which the item belongs.  Note that data items don't */
/*     necessarily occupy contiguous ranges of DAS addresses. */

/*     Base address of data pointers: */


/*     Maximum record pointer size: */


/*     Data pointers are given the value UNINIT to start with; this */
/*     indicates that the data item is uninitialized.  UNINIT is */
/*     distinct from the value NULL.  NOBACK indicates an uninitialized */
