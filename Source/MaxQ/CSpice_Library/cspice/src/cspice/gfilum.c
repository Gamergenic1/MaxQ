/*                                       available in the kernel pool. */

/*                 Neither case nor blanks are significant in METHOD. */
/*                 For example, the string ' eLLipsoid ' is valid. */


/*     ANGTYP      is a string specifying the type of illumination */
/*                 angle for which a search is to be performed. The */
/*                 possible values of ANGTYP are */

/*                    'INCIDENCE' */
/*                    'EMISSION' */

/*                 When the illumination source is the sun, the */
/*                 incidence angle is commonly called the "solar */

/*                 See the Particulars section below for a detailed */
/*                 description of these angles. */

/*                 Neither case nor white space are significant in */

/*                 valid. */


/*     TARGET      is the name of a target body. The point at which the */

/*                 may be any ephemeris object. Case, blanks, and */

/*                 input TARGET. */


/*     FIXREF      is the name of the body-fixed, body-centered */
/*                 reference frame associated with the target body. The */
/*                 input surface point SPOINT is expressed relative to */
/*                 this reference frame, and this frame is used to */
/*                 define the orientation of the target body as a */
/*                 function of time. */

/*                 The string FIXREF is case-insensitive, and leading */

/*                 the observer-surface point vector, the surface point- */
/*                 illumination source vector, and the target body */

/*                 The components of SPOINT have units of km. */


/*     RELATE      is a relational operator used to define a constraint */

/*                 found by this routine indicates the time intervals */
/*                 where the constraint is satisfied. Supported values */
/*                 of RELATE and corresponding meanings are shown below: */

/*                    '>'      The angle is greater than the reference */
/*                             value REFVAL. */

/*                    '<'      The angle is less than the reference */
/*                             value REFVAL. */


/*                   'ABSMAX'  The angle is at an absolute maximum. */

/*                   'ABSMIN'  The angle is at an absolute minimum. */

/*                   'LOCMAX'  The angle is at a local maximum. */

/*                   'LOCMIN'  The angle is at a local minimum. */

/*                The caller may indicate that the window of interest is */
/*                the set of time intervals where the angle is within a */
/*                specified separation from an absolute extremum. The */
/*                argument ADJUST (described below) is used to specify */
/*                this separation. */

/*                Local extrema are considered to exist only in the */
/*                interiors of the intervals comprising the confinement */
/*                window: a local extremum cannot exist at a boundary */
/*                point of the confinement window. */

/*                Case is not significant in the string RELATE. */


/*     REFVAL     is the reference value used together with the argument */
/*                RELATE to define an equality or inequality to be */
/*                satisfied by the specified illumination angle. See the */
/*                discussion of RELATE above for further information. */

/*                The units of REFVAL are radians. */


/*     ADJUST     is a parameter used to modify searches for absolute */
/*                extrema: when RELATE is set to ABSMAX or ABSMIN and */
/*                ADJUST is set to a positive value, GFILUM will find */
/*                times when the specified illumination angle is within */
/*                ADJUST radians of the specified extreme value. */

/*                If ADJUST is non-zero and a search for an absolute */
/*                minimum is performed, the result window contains */
/*                time intervals when the specified illumination angle */
/*                has values between the absolute minimum MIN */
/*                MIN + ADJUST radians. */

/*                If ADJUST is non-zero and the search is for an */
/*                absolute maximum, the corresponding angle is between */
/*                the absolute maximum MAX and MAX - ADJUST radians. */

/*                ADJUST is not used for searches for local extrema, */
/*                equality or inequality conditions. */


/*     STEP       is the step size to be used in the search. STEP must */
/*                be short enough for a search using this step size to */
/*                locate the time intervals where the specified */
/*                illumination angle is monotone increasing or */
/*                decreasing. However, STEP must not be *too* short, or */
/*                the search will take an unreasonable amount of time. */

/*                The choice of STEP affects the completeness but not */
/*                the precision of solutions found by this routine; the */
/*                precision is controlled by the convergence tolerance. */
/*                See the discussion of the parameter CNVTOL for */
/*                details. */

/*                STEP has units of seconds. */


/*     CNFINE     is a SPICE window that confines the time period over */
/*                which the specified search is conducted. CNFINE may */
/*                consist of a single interval or a collection of */
/*                intervals. */

/*                In some cases the confinement window can be used to */
/*                greatly reduce the time window that must be searched */
/*                for the desired solution. See the Particulars section */
/*                below for further discussion. */

/*                See the Examples section below for a code example */
/*                that shows how to create a confinement window. */

/*                CNFINE must be initialized by the caller via the */
/*                SPICELIB routine SSIZED. */


/*     MW         is a parameter specifying the length of the workspace */
/*                array WORK (see description below) used by this */
/*                routine. MW should be at least as large as TWICE the */
/*                number of intervals within the search window on which */
/*                the specified illumination angle is monotone increasing */
/*                or decreasing. It does no harm to pick a value of */
/*                MW larger than the minimum required to execute the */
/*                specified search, but if MW is too small, the */
/*                search will fail. */


/*     WORK       is an array used to store workspace windows. This */
/*                array should be declared by the caller as shown: */

/*                NWILUM is a constant defined in the SPICELIB INCLUDE */
/*                file gf.inc. */

/*                WORK need not be initialized by the caller. */


/*     RESULT     is the result window. RESULT must be initialized via a */
/*                call to SSIZED. RESULT must be declared and initialized */
/*                with sufficient size to capture the full set of time */
/*                intervals within the search window on which the */
/*                specified constraint is satisfied. */


/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*     WORK       is the input workspace array, modified by this */
/*                routine. The caller should re-initialize this array */
/*                before attempting to use it for any other purpose. */

/*     RESULT     is the window of intervals, contained within the */
/*                confinement window CNFINE, on which the specified */
/*                constraint is satisfied. */

/*                The endpoints of the time intervals comprising RESULT */
/*                are interpreted as seconds past J2000 TDB. */

/*                If RESULT is non-empty on input, its contents will be */
/*                discarded before gfilum_c conducts its search. */

/*                If the search is for local extrema, or for absolute */
/*                extrema with ADJUST set to zero, then normally each */
/*                interval of RESULT will be a singleton: the left and */
/*                right endpoints of each interval will be identical. */

/*                If no times within the confinement window satisfy the */
/*                constraint, RESULT will be returned with a */
/*                cardinality of zero. */

/* $ Parameters */

/*     LBCELL     is the lower bound for SPICE Cell arrays. */

/*     CNVTOL     is the default convergence tolerance used for finding */
/*                endpoints of the intervals comprising the result */
/*                window. CNVTOL is also used for finding intermediate */
/*                results; in particular, CNVTOL is used for finding the */
/*                windows on which the specified illumination angle is */
/*                increasing or decreasing. CNVTOL is used to determine */
/*                when binary searches for roots should terminate: when */
/*                a root is bracketed within an interval of length */
/*                CNVTOL, the root is considered to have been found. */

/*                The accuracy, as opposed to precision, of roots found */
/*                by this routine depends on the accuracy of the input */
/*                data. In most cases, the accuracy of solutions will be */
/*                inferior to their precision. */

/*                The calling program can reset the convergence */
/*                tolerance; see the Particulars section below for */
/*                further information. */


/*     NWILUM     is the number of workspace windows required by */
/*                this routine. */

/*     See INCLUDE file gf.inc for declarations and descriptions of */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*     1)  In order for this routine to produce correct results, */
/*         the step size must be appropriate for the problem at hand. */
/*         Step sizes that are too large may cause this routine to miss */
/*         roots; step sizes that are too small may cause this routine */
/*         to run unacceptably slowly and in some cases, find spurious */
/*         roots. */

/*         This routine does not diagnose invalid step sizes, except */
/*         that if the step size is non-positive, the error */
/*         SPICE(INVALIDSTEP) is signaled. */

/*     2)  Due to numerical errors, in particular, */

/*            - Truncation error in time values */
/*            - Finite tolerance value */
/*            - Errors in computed geometric quantities */

/*         it is *normal* for the condition of interest to not always be */
/*         satisfied near the endpoints of the intervals comprising the */
/*         result window. */

/*         The result window may need to be contracted slightly by the */
/*         caller to achieve desired results. The SPICE window routine */
/*         WNCOND can be used to contract the result window. */

/*     3)  If the window size MW is less than 2, the error */
/*         SPICE(INVALIDDIMENSION) will be signaled. */

/*     4)  If the window count NW is less than NWILUM, the error */
/*         SPICE(INVALIDDIMENSION) will be signaled. */

/*     5)  If an error (typically cell overflow) occurs while performing */
/*         window arithmetic, the error will be diagnosed by a routine */
/*         in the call tree of this routine. */

/*     6)  If the output SPICE window RESULT has insufficient capacity */
/*         to hold the set of intervals on which the specified */
/*         illumination angle condition is met, the error will be */
/*         diagnosed by a routine in the call tree of this routine. If */
/*         the result window has size less than 2, the error */
/*         SPICE(INVALIDDIMENSION) will be signaled by this routine. */

/*     7)  If the input target body-fixed frame FIXREF is not */
/*         recognized, an error is signaled by a routine in the call */
/*         tree of this routine. A frame name may fail to be recognized */
/*         because a required frame specification kernel has not been */
/*         loaded; another cause is a misspelling of the frame name. */

/*     8)  If the input frame FIXREF is not centered at the target body, */
/*         an error is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this */
/*         routine. */

/*     9)  If the input argument METHOD is not recognized, the error */
/*         SPICE(INVALIDMETHOD) is signaled. */

/*    10)  If the illumination angle type ANGTYP is not recognized, */
/*         an error is signaled by a routine in the call tree */
/*         of this routine. */

/*    11)  If the relational operator RELATE is not recognized, an */
/*         error is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this */
/*         routine. */

/*    12)  If the aberration correction specifier contains an */
/*         unrecognized value, an error is signaled by a routine in the */
/*         call tree of this routine. */

/*    13)  If ADJUST is negative, an error is signaled by a routine in */
/*         the call tree of this routine. */

/*    14)  If any of the input body names do not map to NAIF ID */
/*         codes, an error is signaled by a routine in the call tree of */
/*         this routine. */

/*    15)  If the target coincides with the observer or the illumination */
/*         source, an error is signaled by a routine in the call tree */
/*         of this routine. */

/*    16)  If required ephemerides or other kernel data are not */
/*         available, an error is signaled by a routine in the call tree */
/*         of this routine. */

/* $ Files */

/*     Appropriate kernels must be loaded by the calling program before */
/*     this routine is called. */

/*     The following data are required: */

/*        - SPK data: ephemeris data for target, observer, and the */
/*          illumination source must be loaded. If aberration */
/*          corrections are used, the states of target, observer, and */
/*          the illumination source relative to the solar system */
/*          barycenter must be calculable from the available ephemeris */
/*          data. Typically ephemeris data are made available by loading */
/*          one or more SPK files via FURNSH. */

/*        - PCK data: if the target body shape is modeled as an */
/*          ellipsoid (currently no other shapes are supported), */
/*          triaxial radii for the target body must be loaded */
/*          into the kernel pool. Typically this is done by loading a */
/*          text PCK file via FURNSH. */

/*        - Further PCK data: rotation data for the target body must be */
/*          loaded. These may be provided in a text or binary PCK file. */

/*        - Frame data: if a frame definition not built into SPICE */
/*          is required to convert the observer and target states to the */
/*          body-fixed frame of the target, that definition must be */
/*          available in the kernel pool. Typically the definition is */
/*          supplied by loading a frame kernel via FURNSH. */

/*     In all cases, kernel data are normally loaded once per program */
/*     run, NOT every time this routine is called. */


/* $ Particulars */

/*     The term "illumination angles" refers to the following set of */

/*           Using the definitions of ET and LT above, the target body's */
/*           orientation at ET - LT is used. The surface normal is */
/*           dependent on the target body's orientation, so the body's */
/*           orientation model must be evaluated for the correct epoch. */


/*           Target body -- illumination source vector */
/*           ----------------------------------------- */

/*           The surface features on the target body near SPOINT will */
/*           appear in a measurement made at ET as they were at ET-LT. */
/*           In particular, lighting on the target body is dependent on */
/*           the apparent location of the illumination source as seen */
/*           from the target body at ET-LT. So, a second light time */
/*           correction is used to compute the position of the */
/*           illumination source relative to the surface point. */


/*        Stellar aberration corrections */
/*        ============================== */

/*        Stellar aberration corrections are applied only if */
/*        light time corrections are applied as well. */

/*           Observer-target surface point body vector */
/*           ----------------------------------------- */

/*           When stellar aberration correction is performed, the */
/*           observer-to-surface point direction vector, which we'll */
/*           call SRFVEC, is adjusted so as to point to the apparent */
/*           position of SPOINT: considering SPOINT to be an ephemeris */
/*           object, SRFVEC points from the observer's position at ET to */
/*           the light time and stellar aberration */
/*           corrected position of SPOINT. */

/*           Target body-illumination source vector */
/*           -------------------------------------- */

/*           The target body-illumination source vector is the apparent */
/*           position of the illumination source, corrected for light */
/*           time and stellar aberration, as seen from the surface point */
/*           SPOINT at time ET-LT. */


/*     Below we discuss in greater detail aspects of this routine's */
/*     solution process that are relevant to correct and efficient */
/*     use of this routine in user applications. */


/*     The Search Process */
/*     ================== */

/*     Regardless of the type of constraint selected by the caller, this */
/*     routine starts the search for solutions by determining the time */
/*     periods, within the confinement window, over which the specified */
/*     illumination angle is monotone increasing and monotone decreasing. */
/*     Each of these time periods is represented by a SPICE window. */
/*     Having found these windows, all of the illumination angle's local */
/*     extrema within the confinement window are known. Absolute extrema */
/*     then can be found very easily. */

/*     Within any interval of these "monotone" windows, there will be at */
/*     most one solution of any equality constraint. Since the boundary */
/*     of the solution set for any inequality constraint is contained in */
/*     the union of */

/*        - the set of points where an equality constraint is met */
/*        - the boundary points of the confinement window */

/*     the solutions of both equality and inequality constraints can be */
/*     found easily once the monotone windows have been found. */


/*     Step Size */
/*     ========= */

/*     The monotone windows (described above) are found via a two-step */
/*     search process. Each interval of the confinement window is */
/*     searched as follows: first, the input step size is used to */
/*     determine the time separation at which the sign of the rate of */
/*     change of the illumination angle will be sampled. Starting at the */
/*     left endpoint of an interval, samples will be taken at each step. */
/*     If a change of sign is found, a root has been bracketed; at that */
/*     point, the time at which the rate of change of the selected */
/*     illumination angle is zero can be found by a refinement process, */
/*     for example, via binary search. */

/*     Note that the optimal choice of step size depends on the lengths */
/*     of the intervals over which the illumination angle is monotone: */
/*     the step size should be shorter than the shortest of these */
/*     intervals (within the confinement window). */

/*     The optimal step size is *not* necessarily related to the lengths */
/*     of the intervals comprising the result window. For example, if */
/*     the shortest monotone interval has length 10 days, and if the */
/*     shortest result window interval has length 5 minutes, a step size */
/*     of 9.9 days is still adequate to find all of the intervals in the */
/*     result window. In situations like this, the technique of using */
/*     monotone windows yields a dramatic efficiency improvement over a */
/*     state-based search that simply tests at each step whether the */
/*     specified constraint is satisfied. The latter type of search can */
/*     miss solution intervals if the step size is longer than the */
/*     shortest solution interval. */

/*     Having some knowledge of the relative geometry of the target, */
/*     observer, and illumination source can be a valuable aid in */
/*     picking a reasonable step size. In general, the user can */
/*     compensate for lack of such knowledge by picking a very short */
/*     step size; the cost is increased computation time. */
/*     Note that the step size is not related to the precision with which */
/*     the endpoints of the intervals of the result window are computed. */
/*     That precision level is controlled by the convergence tolerance. */


/*     Convergence Tolerance */
/*     ===================== */

/*     As described above, the root-finding process used by this routine */
/*     involves first bracketing roots and then using a search process */
/*     to locate them. "Roots" are both times when local extrema are */
/*     attained and times when the illumination angle is equal to a */
/*     reference value. All endpoints of the intervals comprising the */
/*     result window are either endpoints of intervals of the */
/*     confinement window or roots. */

/*     Once a root has been bracketed, a refinement process is used to */
/*     narrow down the time interval within which the root must lie. */
/*     This refinement process terminates when the location of the root */
/*     has been determined to within an error margin called the */
/*     "convergence tolerance." The convergence tolerance used by this */
/*     routine is set via the parameter CNVTOL. */

/*     The value of CNVTOL is set to a "tight" value so that the */
/*     tolerance doesn't become the limiting factor in the accuracy of */
/*     solutions found by this routine. In general the accuracy of input */
/*     data will be the limiting factor. */

/*     The user may change the convergence tolerance from the default */
/*     CNVTOL value by calling the routine GFSTOL, e.g. */

/*        CALL GFSTOL( tolerance value in seconds ) */

/*     Call GFSTOL prior to calling this routine. All subsequent */
/*     searches will use the updated tolerance value. */

/*     Searches over time windows of long duration may require use of */
/*     larger tolerance values than the default: the tolerance must be */
/*     large enough so that it, when added to or subtracted from the */
/*     confinement window's lower and upper bounds, yields distinct time */
/*     values. */

/*     Setting the tolerance tighter than CNVTOL is unlikely to be */
/*     useful, since the results are unlikely to be more accurate. */
/*     Making the tolerance looser will speed up searches somewhat, */
/*     since a few convergence steps will be omitted. */


/*     The Confinement Window */
/*     ====================== */

/*     The simplest use of the confinement window is to specify a time */
/*     interval within which a solution is sought. However, the */
/*     confinement window can, in some cases, be used to make searches */
/*     more efficient. Sometimes it's possible to do an efficient search */
/*     to reduce the size of the time period over which a relatively */
/*     slow search of interest must be performed. */

/* $ Examples */


/*     The numerical results shown for these examples may differ across */
/*     platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as */
/*     input, the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine */
/*     specific arithmetic implementation. */


/*     1) Determine time intervals over which the MER-1 ("Opportunity") */
/*        rover's location satisfies certain constraints on its */
/*        illumination and visibility as seen from the Mars */
/*        Reconaissance Orbiter (MRO) spacecraft. */

/*        In this case we require the emission angle to be less than */
/*        20 degrees and the solar incidence angle to be less than */
/*        60 degrees. */
