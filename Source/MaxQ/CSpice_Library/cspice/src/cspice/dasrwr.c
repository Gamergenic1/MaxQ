/* $ Exceptions */

/* $ Files */

/*     See the description of the argument HANDLE in the headers of */
/*     the entry points for a description of files accessed by this */
/*     set of routines. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     This suite of routines provides buffered read and write access to */
/*     DAS files.  The purpose of this feature is to increase the */
/*     performance of application programs that access DAS files:  in */
/*     particular, repeated reads from or writes to a given record */
/*     should be relatively fast, because the contents of the most */
/*     recently accessed records are buffered in memory.  Thus DASRWR */
/*     and its entry points act as a miniature virtual memory system for */
/*     DAS files. */

/*     These routines are intended primarily for use by other SPICELIB */
/*     routines; users' application programs will not normally need to */
/*     call these routines.  Writing to a DAS file with these routines */
/*     demands a particularly circumspect approach:  it's quite easy to */
/*     end up with something other than a DAS file if one misuses the */
/*     routines. */

/*     The entry points of DASRWR support writing, reading, and updating */
/*     the records in a DAS file.  The distinction between writing and */
/*     updating is that any record may be written (as long as the record */
/*     belongs to a file open for writing), but only existing records */
/*     may be updated.  `Writing' a record sets the values of all of */
/*     the elements of the record, while a subrange of the elements of an */
/*     existing record may be `updated'. */

/*     For each of these three operations, there are three DAS routines, */
/*     one for each supported data type.  The names of the routines are */

/*        -- For writing:     DASWRC,  DASWRD,  DASWRI */
/*        -- For updating:    DASURC,  DASURD,  DASURI */
/*        -- For reading:     DASRRC,  DASRRD,  DASRRI */

/*     Users should note that, unlike in the case of SPICELIB's DAF */
/*     routines, the DAS routines buffer data that is written as well */
/*     as data that is read.  Consequently a DAS file does not */
/*     necessarily yet contain, at any moment, all of the data that */
/*     has been written to it by the DASWRx or DASURx routines.  The */
/*     written data that is buffered is written out when the need */
/*     to buffer additional data requires it, and also when the user */
/*     commands the closure of a file that has been written.  So, at */
/*     the time a DAS file is closed, the contents of the physical file */
/*     do reflect what has been `written' to the file by the DASWRx and */
/*     DASURx entry points. */

/*     At any time, an application program can force the DAS system to */
/*     write to a DAS file any buffered records maintained for that */
/*     file.  The entry point DASWBR (DAS, write buffered records) */
/*     provides this capability. */

/*     DASRWR contains three record buffers:  one of character type, */
/*     one of double precision type, and one of integer type.  Each */
/*     buffer has enough room for an integer number of records.  The */
/*     sizes of the buffers are parameterized and can be increased if */
/*     necessary.  When contemplating the revision of the buffer */
/*     sizes selected by NAIF, SPICELIB users should take note of the */
/*     following points: */

/*        -- Changing values of parameters in NAIF subroutines may cause */
/*           a maintenance burden for the users of the modified NAIF */
/*           code, since any changes made to a SPICELIB routine will have */
/*           to be made to any new version of that routine released by */
/*           NAIF in a later version of SPICELIB. */

/*        -- The effect of buffer size on the speed with which an */
/*           application executes is highly dependent on the specific */
/*           application.  In some cases, increasing the buffer sizes */
/*           may slow the application down. */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*     1)  If the input file handle is invalid, the error will be */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     Routines outside of SPICELIB will normally have no need to call */

/*     This routine can be used to write to only DAS files that are open */

/*     they are cleared from the integer buffer to make room for other */

/*     a call to DASWBR.  In any case, at the moment this routine */
/*     returns, the data supplied on input may be read back by DASRRI */
/*     or updated by DASURI. */

/*     Closing a DAS file via DASCLS forces any remaining updated data */

/*                   containing integers. */

/*     BUFSZI        is the number of records in the integer record */
/*                   buffer. */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*     1)  This routine may be used to update only records that have */
/*         already been written by DASWRI or that already exist in the */
/*         file designated by HANDLE.  Attempting to update a record */
/*         that hasn't yet been written will cause the read operation */
/*         performed by this routine to fail. */

/*         If a read operation attempted by this routine fails for this */
/*         or any other reason, the error will be diagnosed by routines */
/*         called by this routine.  The indicated record will not be */
/*         modified. */

/*     2)  If a write operation attempted by this routine fails, the */
/*         error will be diagnosed by routines called by this routine. */
/*         The status of the DAS file written to is uncertain in this */
/*         case.  Note that the file written to may be different than */
/*         the file designated by HANDLE if multiple DAS files are open */
/*         for writing. */

/*     3)  If the input file handle is invalid, the error will be */
/*         diagnosed by routines called by this routine.  The indicated */
/*         record will not be modified. */

/*     4)  If FIRST or LAST is not in the range [1, NWI], the error */
/*         SPICE(INDEXOUTOFRANGE) will be signaled.  The indicated */
/*         record will not be modified. */

/*     5)  If FIRST > LAST, this routine will return without modifying */
/*         the indicated record. */

/* $ Files */

/*     See the description of the argument HANDLE in $Detailed_Input. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     Routines outside of SPICELIB will normally have no need to call */
/*     this routine. */

/*     This routine can be used to update any existing record in a DAS */
/*     file that is open for writing, or any record that has been */
/*     `written' by DASWRI, whether or not that record has yet been */
/*     physically written to the file it belongs to.  Records that have */
/*     never been written cannot be updated. */

/*     Because the DAS system buffers records that are written, multiple */
/*     updates of parts of a record can be made without incurring a */
/*     large number of file reads and writes. */

/*     This routine should be used to update only records that contain */
/*     integer data. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     1)  Update the 10th through 100th integers in record number 9 */
/*         in a DAS file designated by HANDLE. */

/*             INTEGER               DATAI ( 100 ) */

/*                         . */
/*                         . */
/*                         . */

/*             DO I = 1, 91 */
/*                DATAI  =  I */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     Routines outside of SPICELIB will normally have no need to call */
/*     this routine. */

/*     This routine can be used to update any existing record in a DAS */
/*     file that is open for writing, or any record that has been */
/*     `written' by DASWRC, whether or not that record has yet been */
/*     physically written to the file it belongs to.  Records that have */
/*     never been written cannot be updated. */

/*     Because the DAS system buffers records that are written, multiple */
/*     updates of parts of a record can be made without incurring a */
/*     large number of file reads and writes. */

/*     Any buffered character record can be updated with this routine. */
/*     In particular, records that have been written to the DAS character */
/*     record buffer but have not yet been written out to the DAS file */
/*     they're intended to go to ARE visible to this routine. */

/*     This routine should be used to update only records that contain */
/*     character data. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     1)  Update the 10th through 100th characters in record number 9 */
/*         in a DAS file designated by HANDLE. */

/* $ Files */

/*     See the description of the argument HANDLE in $Detailed_Input. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     This routine writes buffered records out to the DAS file to which */
/*     they correspond.  After the records are written, the buffer */
/*     elements used to store them are deallocated. */

/*     Because the DAS system buffers records that are written as well */
/*     as those that are read, data supplied to the DASWRx and DASURx */
/*     routines on input has not necessarily been physically written to */
/*     the DAS file specified by the caller of those routines, at the */
/*     time those routines return.  Before closing a DAS file that has */
/*     been opened for writing, the DAS system must write out to the */
/*     file any updated records present in the DAS buffers.  The SPICELIB */
/*     routine DASCLS uses this routine to perform this function.  The */
/*     SPICELIB routines DASACR and DASRCR, which respectively add */
/*     comment records to or delete comment records from a DAS file, use */
/*     this routine to ensure that the DASRWR record buffers don't */
/*     become out of sync with the file they operate upon. */

/*     In addition, this routine can be used by application programs */
/*     that create or update DAS files.  The reason for calling this */
/*     routine directly would be to provide a measure of safety when */
/*     writing a very large file:  if the file creation or update were */
/*     interrupted, the amount of work lost due to the loss of buffered, */
/*     unwritten records could be reduced. */

/*     However, routines outside of SPICELIB will generally not need to */
/*     call this routine directly. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     1)  Supply a series of double precision records to DASWRD, */
/*         then force a physical write of those records to the file. */

/*            DO RECNO = 77, 100 */

/*               CALL FILLD  ( DBLE(RECNO), NWD,      RECD ) */
/*               CALL DASWRD ( HANDLE,      RECNO,    RECD ) */

/*            END DO */

/*            CALL DASWBR ( HANDLE ) */


/*     2)  This is the same as example (1), except we force a physical */
/*         write by closing the file. */

/*            DO RECNO = 77, 100 */

/*               CALL FILLD  ( DBLE(RECNO), NWD,      RECD ) */
/*               CALL DASWRD ( HANDLE,      RECNO,    RECD ) */
