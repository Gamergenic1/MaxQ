/* $ Particulars */

/*     This routine returns the cylindrical coordinates of a point */
/*     whose position is input in latitudinal coordinates. */

/*     Latitudinal coordinates are defined by a distance from a central */
/*     reference point, an angle from a reference meridian, and an angle */
/*     above the equator of a sphere centered at the central reference */
/*     point. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     Other than the obvious conversion between coordinate systems */
/*     this routine could be used to obtain the axial projection */
/*     from a sphere to a cylinder about the z-axis that contains */
/*     the equator of the sphere.  The following code fragment */
/*     illustrates this idea. */

/*           CALL LATCYL ( RADIUS, LONG, LAT, R, LONG, Z ) */
/*           R = RADIUS */

/*     R, LONG, and Z now contain the coordinates of the projected */
/*     point. Such a projection is valuable because it preserves the */
/*     areas between regions on the sphere and their projections to the */
/*     cylinder. */
