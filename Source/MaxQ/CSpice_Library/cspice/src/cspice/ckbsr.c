/* $ Detailed_Input */

/*     FNAME      is the name of a binary C-kernel file to be loaded. */

/*     HANDLE     on input is the handle of a binary C-kernel file to be */
/*                unloaded. */


/*     The purpose of entry points CKBSS and CKSNS is to search for */
/*     segments in CK files matching certain criteria. The four */
/*     quantities below establish these search criteria. */


/*     INST       is the NAIF ID of an instrument. */

/*     SCLKDP     is an encoded spacecraft clock time. */

/*     TOL        is a time tolerance, measured in the same units as */
/*                encoded spacecraft clock. */

/*     NEEDAV     indicates whether or not angular velocity data are */
/*                required. */

/*                If true, only segments containing pointing and angular */
/*                velocity data will be checked. If false, segments */
/*                containing just pointing data will also be considered. */


/*     A segment matches the CKBSS/CKSNS search criteria when the */
/*     following statements are true. */

/*        1) INST matches the instrument number for the segment. */

/*        2) The time interval [SCLKDP - TOL, SCLKDP + TOL] intersects */
/*           the time interval of the segment. */

/*        3) If angular velocity data are required, as indicated by */
/*           NEEDAV, the segment contains angular velocity data. */


/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*     HANDLE     on output is the handle of the C-kernel file */
/*                containing a located segment. */

/*     DESCR      is the packed descriptor of a located segment. */

/*     SEGID      is the identifier of a located segment. */

/*     FOUND      indicates whether a requested segment was found or not. */

/* $ Parameters */

/*     FTSIZE     is the maximum number of pointing files that can */
/*                be loaded by CKLPF at any given time for use by the */
/*                readers. */

/*     ITSIZE     is the maximum number of instruments whose segments */
/*                are buffered by CKSNS. */

/*     STSIZE     is the maximum number of segments that can be buffered */
/*                at any given time by CKSNS. */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*     1) If CKBSR is called directly, the error SPICE(CKBOGUSENTRY) */
/*        is signaled. */

/*     2) See entry points CKLPF, CKUPF, CKBSS, and CKSNS for exceptions */
/*        specific to them. */

/* $ Files */

/*     C-kernel pointing files are indicated by filename before loading */
/*     (see CKLPF) and handle after loading (all other places). */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     CKBSR serves as an umbrella, allowing data to be shared by its */
/*     entry points: */

/*        CKLPF       Load pointing file. */
/*        CKUPF       Unload pointing file. */
/*        CKBSS       Begin search for segment. */
/*        CKSNS       Select next segment. */

/*     Before a file can be read by the C-kernel readers, it must be */
/*     loaded by CKLPF, which among other things load the file into */
/*     the DAF subsystem. */

/*     Up to FTSIZE files may be loaded for use simultaneously, and a */
/*     file only has to be loaded once to become a potential search */
/*     target for any number of subsequent reads. */

/*     Once a C-kernel has been loaded, it is assigned a file */
/*     handle, which is used to keep track of the file internally, and */
/*     which is used by the calling program to refer to the file in all */
/*     subsequent calls to CK routines. */

/*     A file may be removed from the list of files for potential */
/*     searching by unloading it via a call to CKUPF. */

/*     CKBSS and CKSNS are used together to search through loaded files */
/*     for segments. */

/*     CKBSS sets up the search. You tell it the instrument and time */
/*     that you are interested in, and whether you require segments */
/*     containing angular velocity data. */

/*     CKSNS finds segments matching the search criteria set up by */
/*     CKBSS. Last-loaded files get searched first, and individual files */
/*     are searched backwards. */

/*     When an applicable segment is found, CKSNS returns that segment's */
/*     descriptor and identifier, along with the handle of the file */
/*     containing the segment. */

/*     Subsequent calls to CKSNS continue the search, picking up where */
/*     the previous call to this routine left off. */

/*     CKSNS uses information on loaded files to manage a buffer */
/*     of saved segment descriptors and identifiers. The buffer is used */
/*     to speed up access time by minimizing file reads. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     Suppose that pointing data for the Voyager 2 narrow angle camera */
/*     for a certain interval of time are contained in three separate */
/*     files:  ORIGINAL.CK contains an original complete set of pointing */
/*     data and UPDATE_1.CK and UPDATE_2.CK contain two separate pointing */
/*     updates for certain pictures in the same time period. */

/*     In the following example, pointing from the C-kernel is extracted */
/*     in two different ways for the purpose of comparing the two */
/*     updates: */

/*     First, the original pointing file and one of the update files are */
/*     both loaded and pointing is retrieved for all of the pictures. */
/*     The update file is searched through first, and if no data for the */
/*     desired picture is located, then the original file provides the */
/*     requested pointing. */

/*     Then, the first update file is unloaded, the second update file */
/*     is loaded, and the same search is performed, as above. */

/*     Throughout the two searches, a fictitious non-SPICELIB routine */
/*     named WRTABL writes an entry into a table that contains */
/*     the pointing of the camera and the file from which the pointing */
/*     came, if such pointing was found.  WRERR, another fictitious, */
/*     non-SPICELIB routine writes an error message if no such pointing */
/*     was found. */

/*     It is assumed that an array (FDS) exists that contains character */
/*     representations of the spacecraft clock time for each picture, */
/*     and that there are NPICS pictures. */

/*     The file table contains the handle and file number of each file */

/*     numbers begin at one, and are incremented until they reach a */
/*     value of INTMAX() - 1, at which point they are mapped to the */
/*     range 1:NFT, where NFT is the number of loaded CK files. */

/*     A file number is similar to a file handle, but it is assigned */
/*     and used exclusively by this module. The purpose of file numbers */
/*     is to keep track of the order in which files are loaded and the */
/*     order in which they are searched. */

/*     All names begin with FT. */

/*        HAN      Handle */
/*        NUM      File number */

/*     NFT is the number of currently loaded CK files. NEXT is */
/*     incremented whenever a new file is loaded to give the file */
/*     number for that file. FINDEX is the index of whatever file is */
/*     of current interest. */

/*     New files are added at the end of the table. As files are */
/*     removed, succeeding files are moved forward to take up the */
/*     slack. This keeps the table ordered by file number. */


/*     The instrument table contains the beginning of the list of the */
/*     stored segments for each spacecraft/instrument pair, and the */
/*     expense at which that list was constructed. (The expense of an */
/*     instrument list is the number of segment descriptors examined */
/*     during the construction of the list.) It also contains the */
/*     highest and lowest file numbers searched during the construction */
/*     of the list. */

/*     For each instrument, the time bounds of the "re-use interval" */
/*     of the last segment found are stored.  This interval is the */
/*     maximal interval containing the epoch of the last request for */
/*     data for this instrument, such that the interval is not masked */
/*     by higher-priority segments.  The handle, segment descriptor, */
/*     and segment identifier returned on the last request are also */
/*     stored. */

/*     The reuse-interval is computed without regard to presence of */
/*     angular velocity:  all segments seen while searching for */
/*     a segment satisfying a request are used to define the bounds */
/*     of the re-use interval. */

/*     Re-use intervals are defined on the *first* search following */
/*     a setup call to CKBSS.  If a search is resumed (multiple calls */
/*     to CKSNS are made consecutively), the re-use interval becomes */

/*     NIT is the number of instruments for which segments are currently */
/*     being stored in the table. IINDEX is the index of whatever */
/*     instrument is of current interest at any given time. */

/*     New instruments are added at the end of the table. As instruments */
/*     are removed, the last instrument is moved forward to take up the */
/*     slack. This keeps the entries in the table contiguous. */


/*     The segment table contains the handle, descriptor, and identifier */
/*     for each segment that has been found so far. */

/*     The segment table is implemented as a set of arrays indexed by */
/*     a SPICE doubly linked list structure.  For each instrument */
/*     in the instrument table, there is a segment table list; each */

/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*     HANDLE     is an integer handle of the file containing the */
/*                segment matching the instrument and time */
/*                specifications made in the last call to CKBSS. */

/*     DESCR, */
/*     SEGID      are the descriptor and identifier of the segment found */

/*                made in the last call to CKBSS. */

/*                other arguments are meaningless. */

/* $ Parameters */

/*     None. */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*     1) If CKSNS is called without CKBSS ever having been called, */
/*        the error 'SPICE(CALLCKBSSFIRST)' is signaled. */

/*     2) If no segment is found that matches the search criteria, */
/*        FOUND is set to false, but the values of HANDLE, DESCR, */
/*        and SEGID will be meaningless. */

/* $ Files */

/*     All files loaded by CKLPF are potential search targets for */
/*     CKSNS. The files are all referred to by their integer handles. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     CKSNS is used to locate segments based on the search criteria */
/*     established by the most recent call to CKBSS.  When a segment */
/*     is found it will have the following characteristics: */

/*        1) Its instrument will match the instrument specified in the */
/*           call to CKBSS. */

/*        2) Its time interval will intersect the time interval */

/*              [SCLKDP - TOL, SCLKDP + TOL], */

/*           where SCLKDP and TOL were specified in the call to CKBSS. */

/*        3) If there is a need for angular velocity data, as specified */
/*           by NEEDAV in the call to CKBSS, a returned segment */
/*           will contain angular velocity data. If there is no need */
/*           for such data, the returned segment may or may not contain */
/*           angular velocity data. */

/*     The first call to CKSNS following a call to CKBSS starts a search */
/*     through loaded files and either returns the first applicable */
/*     segment, or indicates that no segment was found. */

/*     CKSNS searches through last-loaded files first. Individual */
/*     files are searched backwards, so that segments that were inserted */
/*     last into the file get checked first. */

/*     Subsequent calls to CKSNS pick up the search exactly where the */
/*     previous calls left off. If a segment is not found, future calls */
/*     will also indicate that no segment could be found, until a new */
/*     search is begun. */

/*     CKSNS also buffers segment descriptors and identifiers, to */
/*     attempt to minimize file reads. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     See Examples in CKBSR. */

/* $ Restrictions */

/*     1) This subroutine assumes that a search has been initiated by */
/*        a call to CKBSS. */

/*     2) When a CK file is loaded or unloaded, a new search must */
/*        be started via a call to CKBSS before this routine may */
/*        be called. */

/*     CKSNS buffers segment descriptors and identifiers, to */
/*     attempt to minimize file reads. Buffering segments involves */
/*     maintaining three tables:  the file table, the instrument table, */
/*     and the segment table. CKSNS is broken down into various tasks, */
/*     described in the code below, which perform these manipulations. */

/*     A description of the components of each table is provided in */
/*     the declarations section of CKBSR. */

/*     Basically, the buffering is performed as follows: once a request */
/*     for a segment for a particular instrument is made, if there are */
/*     no adequate entries in the buffer already, a search is made */
/*     through loaded files for applicable segments.  Every segment */
/*     pertaining to that instrument in a searched file is buffered, */
/*     before a check of the current buffer is made.  If the search */
/*     doesn't turn up a segment matching the specified search criteria */
/*     the next file is searched and new segments are added to the list, */
/*     and so on. */

/*     The information in the segment table (ST) is stored in a */
/*     doubly-linked list. Each node in the list contains several */
/*     individual pieces of data, which are stored in parallel */
/*     arrays. */

/*     In the following loop, we will try to simplify things by */
/*     doing exactly one thing on each pass through the loop. */
/*     After each pass, the status of the loop (STATUS) will be */
/*     adjusted to reflect the next thing that needs to be done. */
/*     The first task is set by CKBSS. */

/*     Occasionally, the current task will have to be interrupted */
/*     until another task can be carried out. (For example, when */
/*     collecting new segments, an interrupt might place a segment */
/*     at the front or end of the current instrument list; when placing */
/*     the segment on the list, a second interrupt might free */
/*     room in the segment table in order to allow the addition */
/*     to proceed.) In this case, the current task will be saved and */
/*     restored after the more urgent task has been completed. */

/*     The loop can terminate in only one of two ways (unless an error */
/*     occurs). First, if an applicable segment is found in the segment */
/*     table, the handle, descriptor, and identifier for the segment */
/*     are returned immediately.  Second, if the table does not contain */
/*     an applicable segment, and if no files remain to be searched, */
/*     the loop terminates normally, and no data are returned. */

/*     The status is saved on exit, however, so that subsequent calls */
/*     will resume a search exactly where previous calls left off. */

/*     Each status is described below. */

/*     'NEW INSTRUMENT' */

/*        This indicates that the specified spacecraft/instrument has */
/*        no segments stored for it at all. It must be added to the */
/*        instrument table.  (This is followed immediately by an */
/*        OLD FILES search, in which every file loaded is considered an */
/*        old file.) */

/*     'NEW FILES' */

/*        This indicates that at least one new file has been added */
/*        since the last time the segment list for the specified */
/*        instrument was searched. Find the oldest of these new files, */
/*        and begin a NEW SEGMENTS search in forward order for */
/*        segments to add to the front of the list. */

/*     'NEW SEGMENTS' */

/*        Continue a NEW FILES search, adding segments for the specified */
/*        instrument to the front of the list. */

/*     'OLD FILES' */

/*        This indicates that although the list has been searched */
/*        and found to contain no applicable segment, some of the */
/*        older files remain to be searched. Find the newest of these */
/*        old files, and begin an OLD SEGMENTS search in backward order. */

/*     'OLD SEGMENTS' */

/*        Continue an OLD FILES search, adding segments for the specified */
/*        instrument to the end of the list. */

/*     'CHECK LIST' */

/*        This indicates that the list is ready to be searched, */
/*        either because no new files have been added, or because */
/*        segments from a new file or an old file have recently */
/*        been added. */

/*        The list is never checked until all new files have been */
/*        searched. */

/*        If an applicable segment is found, it is returned. */

/*     'MAKE ROOM' (Interrupt) */

/*        This indicates that one of the instruments must be removed, */
/*        along with its stored segments, to make room for another */
/*        instrument or segment.  The instrument (other than the */
/*        specified instrument) with the smallest expense is selected */
/*        for this honor. */

/*     'ADD TO FRONT' (Interrupt) */

/*        This indicates that a segment has been found (during the */
/*        course of a NEW FILES search) and must be added to the front */
/*        of the list. */

/*     'ADD TO END' (Interrupt) */

/*        This indicates that a segment has been found (during the */
/*        course of an OLD FILES search) and must be added to the end */
/*        of the list. */

/*     'PREPARE PARTIAL LIST' */

/*        This indicates that an attempt to 'MAKE ROOM' failed when */
/*        trying to 'ADD TO END' because all of the segments in the */
/*        table were for the instrument being searched on.  The partial */
/*        list is found that contains all of the segments that were in */
/*        the process of being added to the table for the current old */
/*        file.  Next a 'CHECK PARTIAL LIST' is performed. Following */
/*        that, a 'SEARCH W/O BUFF' is performed on all unsearched */
/*        files. */

/*     'CHECK PARTIAL LIST' */

/*        This indicates that a portion of the list can't be buffered. */
/*        Before this portion is freed, it is to be checked for */
/*        applicable segments. */

/*     'SEARCH W/O BUFF' */

/*        This indicates that the segment table was too small to handle */
/*        all of the segments for the current instrument, and that the */
/*        remaining unchecked old files should be searched for applicable */
/*        segments, without buffering the segments. */

/*     'SUSPEND' */

/*        This indicates that the current task (DOING) should be */
/*        interrupted until a more urgent task (URGENT) can be */
/*        carried out. The current task is placed on a stack for */
/*        safekeeping. */

/*     'RESUME' */

/*        This indicates that the most recently interrupted task */
/*        should be resumed immediately. */

/*     '?' */

/*        This indicates that the next task is not immediately */
/*        apparent: if new files exist, they should be searched; */
/*        otherwise the list should be checked. */

/*     'HOPELESS' */

/*        This indicates that the table does not contain an applicable */
/*        segment, and no files remain to be searched. */

/*      'BOGUS ENTRY' */

/*        This is the initial value of STATUS and indicates that no */
/*        call to CKBSS was ever made. If this is the case then an */

/*     This entry point allows the user to query the set of "loaded" */
/*     C-kernels to make sure that at least one C-kernel has been loaded. */
/*     This allows you to avoid making a search of an empty set of */
/*     loaded kernels which forces a SPICELIB error to be signaled. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     Suppose you want to call on of the C-kernel readers, but wish */
/*     to handle the exceptional case of "no kernels loaded" so that */
/*     the SPICELIB exception handling mechanism is avoided in the */
/*     case of an empty set of loaded kernels.  The code fragment */
/*     below shows how you might do this: */

/*        CALL CKHAVE ( LOADED ) */

/*        IF ( LOADED ) THEN */

/*           CALL CKGP ( ... ) */
