-Procedure gfclrh_c ( GF, clear interrupt signal handler status )

-Abstract
 
   Clear the interrupt signal handler status, so that future calls
   to gfbail_c will indicate no interrupt was received.

-Particulars
  
   This routine clears the interrupt signal handler status maintained
   by the GF subsystem. Calling this routine causes the GF interrupt
   signal receipt indicator function gfbail_c to return SPICEFALSE
   until the next interrupt signal is received by a signal handler
   established by the GF system.

   User applications that use default GF interrupt handling should call
   this routine after processing an interrupt signal.

-Examples
 
   1) The code fragment below is from an example program in
      the header of gfocce_c. The code includes a search,
      a call to gfbail_c, which is made to determine whether
      an interrupt signal was received, and a call to 
      gfclrh_c to clear the interrupt signal status.

            ...

            /.
            Turn on interrupt handling and progress reporting.
            ./
            bail = SPICETRUE;
            rpt  = SPICETRUE;

            /.
            Perform the search.
            ./
            gfocce_c ( "ANY",                            
                       "MOON",     "ellipsoid",  "IAU_MOON", 
                       "SUN",      "ellipsoid",  "IAU_SUN",  
                       "LT",       "EARTH",      CNVTOL,    
                       gfstep_c,   gfrefn_c,     rpt,       
                       gfrepi_c,   gfrepu_c,     gfrepf_c, 
                       bail,       gfbail_c,     &cnfine,   
                       &result                              );


            if ( gfbail_c() ) 
            {
               /.
               Clear the CSPICE interrupt indication. This is
               an essential step for programs that continue
               running after an interrupt; gfbail_c will
               continue to return SPICETRUE until this step
               has been performed.
               ./
               gfclrh_c();


               /.
               We've trapped an interrupt signal. In a realistic
               application, the program would continue operation
               from this point. In this simple example, we simply
               display a message and quit.
               ./
               printf ( "\nSearch was interrupted.\n\nThis message "
                        "was written after an interrupt signal\n"
                        "was trapped. By default, the program "
                        "would have terminated \nbefore this message "
                        "could be written.\n\n"                       );
            }
            else
            

            ...


-Restrictions
 
   This routine has no visible effect on operation of user applications
   unless GF interrupt handling is enabled and gfbail_c is used as
   the interrupt signal receipt indicator.
