/* $ Detailed_Input */

/*     HANDLE   The file handle of a binary DAS file which has been */
/*              opened with read access. */

/*     BUFSIZ   The maximum number of comments that may be placed into */
/*              BUFFER. This would typically be the declared array size */
/*              for the Fortran character string array passed into this */
/*              routine. */

/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*     N        The number of comment lines extracted from the comment */
/*              area of the binary DAS file attached to HANDLE. This */
/*              number will be <= BUFSIZ on output. If N = BUFSIZ and */
/*              DONE <> .TRUE. then there are more comments left to to */
/*              extract. If N = 0, then DONE = .TRUE., i.e., there were */
/*              no comments in the comment area. If there are comments */
/*              in the comment area, or comments remaining after the */
/*              extraction process has begun, N > 0, always. */

/*     BUFFER   A list of at most BUFSIZ comments which have been */
/*              extracted from the comment area of the binary DAS */
/*              file attached to HANDLE. */

/*     DONE     A logical flag indicating whether or not all of the */
/*              comment lines from the comment area of the DAS file have */
/*              been read. This variable has the value .TRUE. after the */
/*              last comment line has been read. It will have the value */
/*              .FALSE. otherwise. */

/*              If there are no comments in the comment area, this */
/*              variable will have the value .TRUE., and N = 0. */

/* $ Parameters */

/*     None. */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*     1)   If the size of the output line buffer is is not positive, */
/*          the error SPICE(INVALIDARGUMENT) will be signaled. */

/*     3)   If a comment line in a DAS file is longer than the length */
/*          of a character string array element of BUFFER, the error */
/*          SPICE(COMMENTTOOLONG) will be signaled. */

/*     3)   If there is a mismatch between the number of comment */
/*          characters found and the number of comment characters */
/*          expected, the error SPICE(BADDASCOMMENTAREA) will be */
/*          signaled. */

/*     4)   If the binary DAS file attached to HANDLE is not open for */
/*          reading, an error will be signaled by a routine called by */
/*          this routine. */

/* $ Files */

/*     See argument HANDLE in $ Detailed_Input. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     Binary DAS files contain an area which is reserved for storing */
/*     annotations or descriptive textual information describing the data */
/*     contained in a file. This area is referred to as the ``comment */
/*     area'' of the file. The comment area of a DAS file is a line */
/*     oriented medium for storing textual information. The comment */
/*     area preserves any leading or embedded white space in the line(s) */
/*     of text which are stored, so that the appearance of the of */
/*     information will be unchanged when it is retrieved (extracted) at */
/*     some other time. Trailing blanks, however, are NOT preserved, */
/*     due to the way that character strings are represented in */
/*     standard Fortran 77. */

/*     This routine will read the comments from the comment area of */
/*     a binary DAS file, placing them into a line buffer. If the line */
/*     buffer is not large enough to hold the entire comment area, */
/*     the portion read will be returned to the caller, and the DONE */
/*     flag will be set to .FALSE.. This allows the comment area to be */
/*     read in ``chunks,'' a buffer at a time. After all of the comment */
/*     lines have been read, the DONE flag will be set to .TRUE.. */

/*     This routine can be used to ``simultaneously'' extract comments */
/*     from the comment areas of multiple binary DAS files. See Example */
/*     2 in the $ Examples section. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     Example 1 */
/*     --------- */

/*     The following example will extract the entire comment area of a */
/*     binary DAS file attached to HANDLE, displaying the comments on */
/*     the terminal screen. */

/*     Let */

/*        BUFFER  have the following declaration: */

/*           CHARACTER*(80)  BUFFER(25) */

/*        HANDLE  be the handle of an open binary DAS file. */

/*     then */

/*        BUFSIZ = 25 */
/*        DONE   = .FALSE. */

/*        DO WHILE ( .NOT. DONE ) */

/*           CALL DASEC( HANDLE, BUFSIZ, N, BUFFER, DONE ) */

/*     simultaneously read the comment areas of multiple DAS files. */
/*     For each file, the comments will be displayed on the screen as */
/*     they are extracted. */

/*                   their comment areas displayed. */

/*                   to have their comment areas displayed. */

/*                   we are done extracting the comment area from the */
/*                   DAS file attached to HANDLE(I) */

/* $ Restrictions */

/*     1) The comment area may consist only of printing ASCII characters, */
/*        decimal values 32 - 126. See the MAXPCH and MINPCH parameters */
/*        defined in the $ Local Parameters section. */

/*     2) There is NO maximum length imposed on the significant portion */
/*        of a text line that may be placed into the comment area of a */
/*        DAS file. The maximum length of a line stored in the comment */
/*        area should be kept reasonable, so that they may be easily */
/*        extracted. A good value for this would be 255 characters, as */
/*        this can easily accommodate ``screen width'' lines as well as */
/*        long lines which may contain some other form of information. */
