/*                For brevity we will refer to this object as the */
/*                "instrument," and the frame fixed to this object as */
/*                the "instrument frame" or "instrument-fixed" frame. */

/*     SCLKDP     is the encoded spacecraft clock time for which */
/*                pointing is requested. */

/*                The SPICELIB routines SCENCD and SCE2C respectively */
/*                convert spacecraft clock strings and ephemeris time to */
/*                encoded spacecraft clock.  The inverse conversions are */
/*                performed by SCDECD and SCT2E. */

/*     TOL        is a time tolerance in ticks, the units of encoded */
/*                spacecraft clock time. */

/*                The SPICELIB routine SCTIKS converts a spacecraft */
/*                clock tolerance duration from its character string */
/*                representation to ticks.  SCFMT performs the inverse */
/*                conversion. */

/*                The C-matrix returned by CKGP is the one whose time */
/*                tag is closest to SCLKDP and within TOL units of */
/*                SCLKDP.  (More in Particulars, below.) */

/*                In general, because using a non-zero tolerance */
/*                affects selection of the segment from which the */
/*                data is obtained, users are strongly discouraged */
/*                from using a non-zero tolerance when reading CKs */
/*                with continuous data. Using a non-zero tolerance */
/*                should be reserved exclusively to reading CKs with */
/*                discrete data because in practice obtaining data */
/*                from such CKs using a zero tolerance is often not */
/*                possible due to time round off. */

/*     REF        is the desired reference frame for the returned */
/*                pointing.  The returned C-matrix CMAT gives the */
/*                orientation of the instrument designated by INST */
/*                relative to the frame designated by REF.  When a */
/*                vector specified relative to frame REF is left- */
/*                multiplied by CMAT, the vector is rotated to the */
/*                frame associated with INST.  See the discussion of */
/*                CMAT below for details. */

/*                Consult the SPICE document "Frames" for a discussion */
/*                of supported reference frames. */

/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*     CMAT       is a rotation matrix that transforms the components of */
/*                a vector expressed in the reference frame specified by */
/*                REF to components expressed in the frame tied to the */
/*                instrument, spacecraft, or other structure at time */
/*                CLKOUT (see below). */

/*                Thus, if a vector v has components x,y,z in the REF */
/*                reference frame, then v has components x',y',z' in the */
/*                instrument fixed frame at time CLKOUT: */

/*                     [ x' ]     [          ] [ x ] */
/*                     | y' |  =  |   CMAT   | | y | */
/*                     [ z' ]     [          ] [ z ] */

/*                If you know x', y', z', use the transpose of the */
/*                C-matrix to determine x, y, z as follows: */

/*                     [ x ]      [          ]T    [ x' ] */
/*                     | y |  =   |   CMAT   |     | y' | */
/*                     [ z ]      [          ]     [ z' ] */
/*                              (Transpose of CMAT) */


/*     CLKOUT     is the encoded spacecraft clock time associated with */
/*                the returned C-matrix. This value may differ from the */
/*                requested time, but never by more than the input */
/*                tolerance TOL. */

/*                The particulars section below describes the search */
/*                algorithm used by CKGP to satisfy a pointing */
/*                request.  This algorithm determines the pointing */
/*                instance (and therefore the associated time value) */
/*                that is returned. */

/*     FOUND      is true if a record was found to satisfy the pointing */
/*                request.  FOUND will be false otherwise. */

/* $ Parameters */

/*     None. */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*     1)  If a C-kernel file has not been loaded using FURNSH prior to */
/*         a call to this routine, an error is signaled by a routine in */
/*         the call tree of this routine. */

/*     2)  If TOL is negative, found is set to .FALSE. */

/*     3)  If REF is not a supported reference frame, an error is */
/*         signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine and */
/*         FOUND is set to .FALSE. */

/* $ Files */

/*     CKGP searches through files loaded by FURNSH to locate a */
/*     segment that can satisfy the request for pointing for instrument */
/*     INST at time SCLKDP.  You must load a C-kernel file using FURNSH */
/*     prior to calling this routine. */

/*     Tolerance and segment priority */
/*     ============================== */

/*     CKGP searches through loaded C-kernels to satisfy a pointing */
/*     request. Last-loaded files are searched first. Individual files */
/*     are searched in backwards order, so that between competing */
/*     segments (segments containing data for the same object, for */
/*     overlapping time ranges), the one closest to the end of the file */
/*     has highest priority. */

/*     The search ends when a segment is found that can provide pointing */
/*     for the specified instrument at a time falling within the */
/*     specified tolerance on either side of the request time. Within */
/*     that segment, the instance closest to the input time is located */
/*     and returned. */

/*     The following four cases illustrate this search procedure. */
/*     Segments A and B are in the same file, with segment A located */
/*     further towards the end of the file than segment B. Both segments */
/*     A and B contain discrete pointing data, indicated by the number */
/*     0. */


/*     Case 1:  Pointing is available in the first segment searched. */
/*              Because segment A has the highest priority and can */
/*              satisfy the request, segment B is not searched. */

/*     Segments that contain continuous pointing data are searched in */

/*     For request times that fall within the bounds of continuous */
