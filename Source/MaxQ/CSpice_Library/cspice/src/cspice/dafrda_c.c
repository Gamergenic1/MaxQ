-Procedure dafrda_c ( DAF, read data from address )

-Abstract

   Read the double precision data bounded by two addresses within
   a DAF.

   Deprecated:  This routine has been superseded by dafgda_c and
   dafgsr_c.  This routine is supported for purposes of backward
   compatibility only.

-Brief_I/O

   Variable  I/O  Description
   --------  ---  --------------------------------------------------
   handle     I   Handle of a DAF.
   begin,
   end        I   Initial, final address within file.
   data       O   Data contained between begin and end.

-Detailed_Input

   handle      is the handle of a DAF.

   begin,
   end         are the initial and final addresses of a contiguous
               set of double precision numbers within a DAF.
               Presumably, these make up all or part of a particular
               array.
               
               Note that CSPICE DAF addresses begin at 1 as in the 
               FORTRAN version of the SPICE Toolkit.
               
-Detailed_Output

   data        are the double precision data contained between
               the specified addresses within the specified file.

-Parameters

   None.

-Exceptions

   1) If `begin' is zero or negative, the error SPICE(DAFNEGADDR)
      is signaled.

   2) If the begin > end, the error SPICE(DAFBEGGTEND)
      is signaled.

   3) If the file associated with `handle' is not of the native
      binary file format this routine signals the error
      SPICE(UNSUPPORTEDBFF).

   4) If `handle' is invalid, routines in the call tree of dafrda_c
      signal an appropriate error.

-Files

   None.

-Particulars

   The principal reason that DAFs are so easy to use is that
   the data in each DAF are considered to be one long contiguous
   set of double precision numbers. You can grab data from anywhere
   within a DAF without knowing (or caring) about the physical
   records in which they are stored.

   This routine has been made obsolete by the routines dafgda_c and
   dafgsr_c.  This routine is supported for reasons of backward
   compatibility only.  New software development should utilize
   dafgda_c or dafgsr_c.

-Examples

   The following code fragment illustrates the use of dafrda_c
   to read data from an imaginary array. The array begins with a
   directory containing 11 epochs. Each pair of epochs bounds
   an interval, and each interval is covered by a set of eight
   osculating elements.

      #include "SpiceUsr.h"
      
         .
         .
         .
      
      dafus_c ( sum, nd, ni, dc, ic );
      begin = ic[4];
      end   = ic[5];

      dafrda_c ( handle, begin, begin+10, epochs );

      for ( i = 0;  i < 10;  i++ )
      {
         if (     ( et > epochs[i]   )
              &&  ( et < epochs[i+1] ) ) 
         {
            offset = ic[4] + 11 + (i - 1) * 8;
            dafrda_c ( handle, offset+1, offset+8, elements );
            return;
         }
      }

      dafgsr_c.

-Version

   -CSPICE Version 1.0.3, 19-MAY-2010 (BVS)

        Index line now states that this routine is deprecated.

   -CSPICE Version 1.0.2, 23-JAN-2008 (EDW)

      Removed a spurious and unneeded "-Declarations"
      tag. The tag's presence prevented the HTML API doc
      script from parsing the function description.

   -CSPICE Version 1.0.1, 27-OCT-2003 (NJB) (FST)

       The header now states that this routine is deprecated.
       The Exceptions header section has been extended.
       Minor additional header updates were made.
