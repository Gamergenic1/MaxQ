-Procedure bsrchd_c ( Binary search for a double precision value )

-Abstract
 
   Do a binary search for a key value within a double precision array, 
   assumed to be in increasing order. Return the index of the matching 
   array entry, or -1 if the key value is not found.

-Brief_I/O
 
   VARIABLE  I/O  DESCRIPTION 
   --------  ---  -------------------------------------------------- 
   value      I   Value to find in array. 
   ndim       I   Dimension of array. 
   array      I   Array to be searched. 

   The function returns the index of the input key value in the
   input array, or -1 if the value is not found.

-Detailed_Input
 
   value       is the value to be found in the input array. 

   ndim        is the number of elements in the input array. 

   array       is the array to be searched. The elements in the
               array are assumed to sorted in increasing order. 

-Detailed_Output
 
   The function returns the index of the input value in the input array. 
   Indices range from zero to ndim-1.

   If the input array does not contain the specified value, the function 
   returns -1. 
 
   If the input array contains more than one occurrence of the specified
   value, the returned index may point to any of the occurrences. 
 
-Parameters
 
   None. 
 
-Exceptions
 
   Error free. 

   If ndim < 1 the value of the function is -1. 

-Files
 
   None. 

-Particulars
 
   A binary search is performed on the input array. If an element of
   the array is found to match the input value, the index of that
   element is returned. If no matching element is found, -1 is
   returned.

-Examples
 
   Let array contain the following elements: 

      -11.0
        0.0
       22.0
      750.0

   Then 

      bsrchd_c ( -11.0, 4, array )   ==  0
      bsrchd_c (  22.0, 4, array )   ==  2 
      bsrchd_c ( 751.0, 4, array )   == -1 

-Restrictions
 
   array is assumed to be sorted in increasing order. If this 
   condition is not met, the results of bsrchd_c are unpredictable.
