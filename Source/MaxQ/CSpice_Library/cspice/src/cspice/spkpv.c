/*     REF        I   Target reference frame. */
/*     STATE      O   Position, velocity. */
/*     CENTER     O   Center of state. */

/* $ Detailed_Input */

/*     HANDLE, */
/*     DESCR       are the file handle assigned to a SPK file, and the */
/*                 descriptor for a segment within the file. Together */
/*                 they determine the ephemeris data from which the */
/*                 state of the body is to be computed. */

/*     ET          is the epoch (ephemeris time) at which the state */
/*                 is to be computed. */

/*     REF         is the name of the reference frame to */
/*                 which the vectors returned by the routine should */
/*                 be rotated. This may be any frame supported by */
/*                 the SPICELIB subroutine FRMCHG. */

/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*     STATE       contains the position and velocity, at epoch ET, */
/*                 for whatever body is covered by the specified segment. */
/*                 STATE has six elements:  the first three contain the */
/*                 body's position; the last three contain the body's */
/*                 velocity.  These vectors are rotated into the */
/*                 specified reference frame, the origin of */
/*                 which is located at the center of motion for the */
/*                 body (see CENTER, below).  Units are always km and */
/*                 km/sec. */

/*     CENTER      is the integer ID code of the center of motion for */
/*                 the state. */

/* $ Parameters */

/*     NONE. */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*     1) If the requested reference frame is not supported by the */
/*        current version of CHGIRF, the error 'SPICE(SPKREFNOTSUPP)' */
/*        is signalled. */

/*     has now largely been replaced by SPKPVN. SPKPV should not normally */
/*     be called except by old software written before the release of */
/*     SPKPVN. This routine should be considered obsolete. */
