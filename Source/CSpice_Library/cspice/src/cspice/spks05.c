/*                 beginning and ending addresses of a segment within */

/*                 extracted. */

/*     BEGIN, */
/*     END         are the initial and final epochs (ephemeris time) */

/*                 The first epoch for which there will be ephemeris */
/*                 data in the new segment will be the greatest time */

/*                 to BEGIN. */

/*                 The last epoch for which there will be ephemeris */
/*                 data in the new segment will be the smallest time */

/* $ Exceptions */

/* $ Files */

/*     Data is extracted from the file connected to the input */
/*     handle, and written to the current DAF open for writing. */

/*     The segment descriptor and summary must already have been written */
/*     prior to calling this routine.  The segment must be ended */
/*     external to this routine. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     This routine is intended solely for use as a utility by the */
/*     routine SPKSUB. */

/*     It transfers a subset of a type 05 SPK data segment to */
/*     a properly initialized segment of a second SPK file. */

/*     The exact structure of a segment of data type 05 is described */
/*     in the section on type 05 in the SPK Required Reading. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     This routine is intended only for use as a utility by SPKSUB. */
/*     To use this routine successfully, you must: */

/*        Open the SPK file from which to extract data. */
/*        Locate the segment from which data should be extracted. */

/*        Open the SPK file to which this data should be written. */
/*        Begin a new segment (array). */
/*        Write the summary information for the array. */

/*        Call this routine to extract the appropriate data from the */
/*        SPK open for read. */

/*        End the array to which this routine writes data. */

/*     Much of this procedure is carried out by the routine SPKSUB.  The */
/*     examples of that routine illustrate more fully the process */
/*     described above. */
