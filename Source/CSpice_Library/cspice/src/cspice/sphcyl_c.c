   VARIABLE  I/O  DESCRIPTION 
   --------  ---  ------------------------------------------------- 
   radius     I   Distance of point from origin. 
   colat      I   Polar angle (co-latitude in radians) of point. 
   slon       I   Azimuthal angle (longitude) of point (radians). 
   r          O   Distance of point from Z axis. 
   lon        O   angle (radians) of point from XZ plane. 
   z          O   Height of point above XY plane. 
 
-Detailed_Input
 
   radius     Distance of the point from origin. 
 
   colat      Polar angle (co-latitude in radians) of the point. 
 
   slon       Azimuthal angle (longitude) of the point (radians). 
 
-Detailed_Output
 
   r          Distance of the point of interest from Z axis. 
 
   lon        cylindrical angle (radians) of the point from the 
              XZ plane. `lon' is set equal to `slon'. 
 
   z          Height of the point above XY plane.

-Particulars
 
   This returns the cylindrical coordinates of a point whose 
   position is input through spherical coordinates. 
 
-Examples
 
   Other than the obvious conversion between coordinate systems 
   this routine could be used to obtain the axial projection 
   from a sphere to a cylinder about the z-axis that contains 
   the equator of the sphere.  The following code fragment 
   illustrates this idea. 
 
         sphcyl_c ( radius, colat,  lon, r,  lon, z ) 
         r = radius 
 
   r,  lon, and z now contain the coordinates of the projected 
   point. Such a projection is valuable because it preserves the 
   areas between regions on the sphere and their projections to the 
   cylinder.
