/* $ Particulars */

/*     This routine returns the latitudinal coordinates of a point */
/*     whose position is input in spherical coordinates. */

/*     Latitudinal coordinates are defined by a distance from a central */
/*     reference point, an angle from a reference meridian, and an angle */
/*     above the equator of a sphere centered at the central reference */
/*     point. */

/*     Spherical coordinates are defined by a distance from a central */
/*     reference point, an angle from a reference meridian, and an angle */
/*     from the z-axis. */

/* $ Examples */


/*     Latitude is obtained by subtracting co-latitude from HALFPI() */
/*     Radius and longitude mean the same thing in both latitudinal */
/*     and spherical coordinates.  The table below lists LAT and */
/*     corresponding COLAT in terms of degrees. */
