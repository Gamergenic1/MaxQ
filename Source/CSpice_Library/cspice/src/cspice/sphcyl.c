/* $ Particulars */

/*     This returns the cylindrical coordinates of a point whose */
/*     position is input through spherical coordinates. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     Other than the obvious conversion between coordinate systems */
/*     this routine could be used to obtain the axial projection */
/*     from a sphere to a cylinder about the z-axis that contains */
/*     the equator of the sphere.  The following code fragment */
/*     illustrates this idea. */

/*           CALL SPHCYL ( RADIUS, COLAT, LONG, R, LONG, Z ) */
/*           R = RADIUS */

/*     R, LONG, and Z now contain the coordinates of the projected */
/*     point. Such a projection is valuable because it preserves the */
/*     areas between regions on the sphere and their projections to the */
/*     cylinder. */
