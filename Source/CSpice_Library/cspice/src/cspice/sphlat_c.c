   r          I   Distance of the point from the origin. 
   colat      I   Angle of the point from positive z axis (radians). 
   lons       I   Angle of the point from the XZ plane (radians). 
   radius     O   Distance of a point from the origin 
   lon        O   Angle of the point from the XZ plane in radians 
   lat        O   Angle of the point from the XY plane in radians 
 
-Detailed_Input
 
   r          Distance of the point from the origin. 
 
   colat      Angle between the vector from the origin to the point 
              and the positive z axis in radians. 
 
   lons       Angle of the point from the XZ plane (radians). 
  
-Detailed_Output
 
   radius     Distance of a point from the origin 
 
   lon        Angle of the point from the XZ plane in radians. `lon'
              is set equal to `lons'.
 
   lat        Angle of the point from the XY plane in radians. `lat'
              is computed as pi/2 - `colat'.

-Particulars
 
   This routine returns the latitudinal coordinates of a point 
   whose position is input in spherical coordinates. 
 
   Latitudinal coordinates are defined by a distance from a central 
   reference point, an angle from a reference meridian, and an angle 
   above the equator of a sphere centered at the central reference 
   point. 
 
   Spherical coordinates are defined by a distance from a central 
   reference point, an angle from a reference meridian, and an angle 
   from the z-axis. 
 
-Examples
 
 
   Latitude is obtained by subtracting co-latitude from HALFPI() 
   Radius and longitude mean the same thing in both latitudinal 
   and spherical coordinates.  The table below lists lat and 
   corresponding colat in terms of degrees.
