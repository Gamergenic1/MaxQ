/* $ Detailed_Input */

/*     EADDR       are the file handle assigned to a SPK file, and the */
/*                 beginning and ending addresses of a segment within */
/*                 the file.  Together they determine a complete set of */

/*                 extracted. */

/*     BEGIN, */

/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*     open for write access. */

/* $ Parameters */

/*     None. */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*     1)  Any errors that occur while reading data from the source SPK */
/*         file will be diagnosed by routines in the call tree of this */
/*         routine. */

/*     2)  Any errors that occur while writing data to the output SPK */
/*         file will be diagnosed by routines in the call tree of this */
