/* $ Files */

/*          time period specified by the window CNFINE. If aberration */
/*          corrections are used, the states of target and observer */
/*          relative to the solar system barycenter must be calculable */
/*          from the available ephemeris data. Typically ephemeris data */
/*          are made available by loading one or more SPK files using */
/*          FURNSH. */

/*        - PCK data: bodies modeled as triaxial ellipsoids must have */
/*          semi-axis lengths provided by variables in the kernel pool. */
/*          Typically these data are made available by loading a text */
/*          PCK file using FURNSH. */

/*        - If non-inertial reference frames are used, then PCK */
/*          files, frame kernels, C-kernels, and SCLK kernels may be */
/*          needed. */

/*     Such kernel data are normally loaded once per program */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     This routine provides a simpler, but less flexible interface */
/*     than does the routine GFEVNT for conducting searches for */
/*     angular separation events. Applications that require support for */
/*     progress reporting, interrupt handling, non-default step or */
/*     refinement functions, or non-default convergence tolerance should */
/*     call GFEVNT rather than this routine. */

/*     This routine determines a set of one or more time intervals */
/*     within the confinement window for which the angular separation */
/*     between the two bodies satisfies some defined relationship. */
/*     The resulting set of intervals is returned as a SPICE window. */

/*     Below we discuss in greater detail aspects of this routine's */
/*     solution process that are relevant to correct and efficient */
/*     use of this routine in user applications. */

/*     The Search Process */
/*     ================== */

/*     Regardless of the type of constraint selected by the caller, this */
/*     routine starts the search for solutions by determining the time */
/*     periods, within the confinement window, over which the specified */
/*     angular separation function is monotone increasing and monotone */
/*     decreasing. Each of these time periods is represented by a SPICE */
/*     window. Having found these windows, all of the angular separation */
/*     function's local extrema within the confinement window are known. */
/*     Absolute extrema then can be found very easily. */

/*     Within any interval of these "monotone" windows, there will be at */
/*     most one solution of any equality constraint. Since the boundary */
/*     of the solution set for any inequality constraint is contained in */
/*     the union of */

/*        - the set of points where an equality constraint is met */
/*        - the boundary points of the confinement window */

/*     the solutions of both equality and inequality constraints can be */
/*     found easily once the monotone windows have been found. */


/*     Step Size */
/*     ========= */

/*     The monotone windows (described above) are found using a two-step */
/*     search process. Each interval of the confinement window is */
/*     searched as follows: first, the input step size is used to */
/*     determine the time separation at which the sign of the rate of */
/*     change of angular separation (angular separation rate) will be */
/*     sampled. Starting at the left endpoint of an interval, samples */
/*     will be taken at each step. If a change of sign is found, a */
/*     root has been bracketed; at that point, the time at which the */
/*     angular separation rate is zero can be found by a refinement */
/*     process, for example, using a binary search. */

/*     Note that the optimal choice of step size depends on the lengths */
/*     of the intervals over which the distance function is monotone: */
/*     the step size should be shorter than the shortest of these */
/*     intervals (within the confinement window). */

/*     The optimal step size is *not* necessarily related to the lengths */
/*     of the intervals comprising the result window. For example, if */
/*     the shortest monotone interval has length 10 days, and if the */
/*     shortest result window interval has length 5 minutes, a step size */
/*     of 9.9 days is still adequate to find all of the intervals in the */
/*     result window. In situations like this, the technique of using */
/*     monotone windows yields a dramatic efficiency improvement over a */
/*     state-based search that simply tests at each step whether the */
/*     specified constraint is satisfied. The latter type of search can */
/*     miss solution intervals if the step size is longer than the */
/*     shortest solution interval. */

/*     Having some knowledge of the relative geometry of the target and */
/*     observer can be a valuable aid in picking a reasonable step size. */
/*     In general, the user can compensate for lack of such knowledge by */
/*     picking a very short step size; the cost is increased computation */
/*     time. */

/*     Note that the step size is not related to the precision with which */
/*     the endpoints of the intervals of the result window are computed. */
/*     That precision level is controlled by the convergence tolerance. */


/*     Convergence Tolerance */
/*     ===================== */

/*     As described above, the root-finding process used by this routine */
/*     involves first bracketing roots and then using a search process */
/*     to locate them. "Roots" are both times when local extrema are */
/*     attained and times when the distance function is equal to a */
/*     reference value. All endpoints of the intervals comprising the */
/*     result window are either endpoints of intervals of the */
/*     confinement window or roots. */

/*     Once a root has been bracketed, a refinement process is used to */
/*     narrow down the time interval within which the root must lie. */
/*     This refinement process terminates when the location of the root */
/*     has been determined to within an error margin called the */
/*     "convergence tolerance." The default convergence tolerance */
/*     used by this routine is set by the parameter CNVTOL (defined */
/*     in gf.inc). */

/*     The value of CNVTOL is set to a "tight" value so that the */
/*     tolerance doesn't become the limiting factor in the accuracy of */
/*     solutions found by this routine. In general the accuracy of input */
/*     data will be the limiting factor. */

/*     The user may change the convergence tolerance from the default */
/*     CNVTOL value by calling the routine GFSTOL, e.g. */

/*        CALL GFSTOL( tolerance value ) */

/*     Call GFSTOL prior to calling this routine. All subsequent */
/*     searches will use the updated tolerance value. */

/*     Setting the tolerance tighter than CNVTOL is unlikely to be */
/*     useful, since the results are unlikely to be more accurate. */
/*     Making the tolerance looser will speed up searches somewhat, */
/*     since a few convergence steps will be omitted. However, in most */
/*     cases, the step size is likely to have a much greater effect */
/*     on processing time than would the convergence tolerance. */


/*     The Confinement Window */
/*     ====================== */

/*     The simplest use of the confinement window is to specify a time */
/*     interval within which a solution is sought. However, the */
/*     confinement window can, in some cases, be used to make searches */
/*     more efficient. Sometimes it's possible to do an efficient search */
/*     to reduce the size of the time period over which a relatively */
/*     slow search of interest must be performed. */


/*     Negative Angular Separation */
/*     =========================== */

/*     For those searches using a SPHERE shape identifier for both */
/*     target bodies, the angular separation function returns a */
/*     negative value when the bodies overlap (occult), e.g. */
/*     a search for an ABSMIN of angular separation in a */
/*     confinement window covering an occultation event will */
/*     return the time when the apparent center of the */

/*     1) The kernel files to be used by this routine must be loaded */
/*        (normally using the SPICELIB routine FURNSH) before this */
/*        routine is called. */

/*     2) This routine has the side effect of re-initializing the */

/*        need to re-initialize the package after calling this routine. */

/*     3) Due to the current logic implemented in ZZGFSPU, a direct */
