/*      --------  ---  -------------------------------------------------- */
/*      STRING     I   any character string */

/*       The function returns the first character of the string. */

/* $ Detailed_Input */

/*     STRING      is any character string */

/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*     The function returns the first character of the string */

/* $ Parameters */

/*      None. */

/* $ Files */

/*      None. */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*     Error free. */


/* $ Particulars */

/*     This is a utility routine so that formal arguments to a routine */
/*     that are never used can be given the appearance of being used */
/*     to a compiler.  In this way it is possible to leave "hooks" in */
/*     a calling sequence even if those variables are for the moment */
/*     unused.  Similarly, variables declared for future use can be left */
/*     in place so that they don't need to be commented out */

/* $ Examples */

/*     Suppose that a routine takes as an argument a */
/*     fortran structure implemented as a set of parallel arrays. */
/*     But that one of the arrays is not needed for the purposes of */
/*     the routine.  This routine allows you to touch that array */
/*     without changing it. */


/*        SUBROUTINE INCPTR ( N, PTR, VALUES ) */

/*        This routine increments the current pointer into a circular */
/*        array of character strings. */

/*        INTEGER               N */
/*        INTEGER               PTR */
/*        CHARACTER*(*)         VALUES ( * ) */

/*        Even though we don't need to do anything with the values */
/*        array, it's passed for the sake of uniformity in calling */
/*        sequences.  Touch the VALUES array so that the compiler */
/*        will think it's been used. */

/*        VALUES(1)(1:1) = TOUCHC ( VALUES(1)(1:1) ) */

/*        PTR = PTR + 1 */

/*        IF ( PTR .GT. N ) THEN */
/*           PTR = 1 */
/*        END IF */
/*        RETURN */



/* $ Restrictions */

/*     If you use this routine, it would be a very good idea to */
/*     write down why you are using it in the calling routine. */

/* $ Author_and_Institution */
