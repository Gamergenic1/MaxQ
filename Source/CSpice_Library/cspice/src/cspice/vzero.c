/*     V          I   Vector to be tested. */

/*     The function returns the value .TRUE. if and only if V is the */
/*     zero vector. */

/* $ Detailed_Input */

/*     V              is a vector in 3-space. */

/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*     The function returns the value .TRUE. if and only if V is the */
/*     zero vector. */

/* $ Parameters */

/*     None. */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*     Error free. */

/* $ Files */

/*     None. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     This function has the same truth value as the logical expression */

/*        VNORM ( V )  .EQ.  0.D0 */

/*     Replacing the above expression by */

/*        VZERO ( V ) */

/*     has several advantages:  the latter expresses the test more */
/*     clearly, looks better, and doesn't go through the work of scaling, */
/*     squaring, taking a square root, and re-scaling (all of which */
/*     VNORM must do) just to find out that a vector is non-zero. */

/*     A related function is VZEROG, which accepts vectors of arbitrary */
/*     dimension. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     1)  When testing whether a vector is the zero vector, one */
/*         normally constructs tests like */

/*            IF (  VNORM ( V )  .EQ.  0.D0  ) THEN */
/*                        . */
/*                        . */
/*                        . */


/*         These can be replaced with the code */

/*            IF (  VZERO ( V )  ) THEN */
/*                        . */
/*                        . */
/*                        . */


/*      2)  Check that a normal vector is non-zero before creating */
/*         a plane with PNV2PL: */

/*         IF (  VZERO ( NORMAL )  )  THEN */

/*            [ handle error ] */

/*         ELSE */

/*            CALL PNV2PL ( POINT, NORMAL, PLANE ) */
/*                          . */
/*                          . */
/*                          . */
