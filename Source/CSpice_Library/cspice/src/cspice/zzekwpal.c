/*     These files use a paged DAS file as their underlying file */
/*     structure. */

/*     In paged DAS EK files, data pages are structured:  they contain */

/*     few addresses of each page, so as to interfere as little as */

/*     Each data page belongs to exactly one segment.  Some bookkeeping */
/*     information, such as record pointers, is also stored in data */
/*     pages. */

/*     Each page contains a forward pointer that allows rapid lookup */
/*     of data items that span multiple pages.  Each page also keeps */
/*     track of the current number of links from its parent segment */
/*     to the page.  Link counts enable pages to `know' when they */
/*     are no longer in use by a segment; unused pages are deallocated */
/*     and returned to the free list. */

/*     The parameters in this include file depend on the parameters */
/*     declared in the include file ekpage.inc.  If those parameters */
/*     change, this file must be updated.  The specified parameter */
