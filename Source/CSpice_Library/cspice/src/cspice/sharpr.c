/* $ Abstract */

/*     Given a matrix that is "nearly" a rotation, adjust the columns */
/*     (from left to right in the usual printed presentation of a matrix) */
/*     so that the columns are numerically unit length and orthogonal. */

/*     ROT       I/O  The rotation matrix to be sharpened. */

/* $ Detailed_Input */

/*     ROT       a 3x3 matrix that is nearly a rotation matrix. */

/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*     ROT       the input after sharpening the columns. */

/* $ Parameters */

/*     None. */

/* $ Files */

/*     None. */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*     Error free. */

/*     1) This routine is not meant to be used on singular or near- */
/*        singular matrices (in other words, matrices with determinant */
/*        close to zero). */

/*        If the input matrix is singular, the output matrix may not */
/*        be a rotation matrix.  In any case, the results should be */
/*        considered unreliable in this case. */

/*        No error handling is done for invalid input matrices. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     This routine "sharpens" the orthogonality of a potential */
/*     rotation matrix.  It is intended for use in those situations */
/*     in which you have a rotation matrix that may be derived */
/*     from single precision inputs or that may have experienced */
/*     round off errors in its construction. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     Suppose that you have a rotation matrix that needs to be */
/*     converted to a quaternion.  The SPICE matrix to quaternion */
/*     conversion routine M2Q performs error checks on the input */
/*     matrix and signals an error if it does not meet the checks */
/*     for a quaternion.  By calling this routine you can ensure that */
/*     your rotation matrix (provided it's non-singular) will pass */
/*     the restrictions imposed by M2Q. */

/*         CALL SHARPR ( ROT ) */
/*         CALL M2Q    ( ROT, Q ) */

/* $ Restrictions */

/*     See the Exceptions section above. */
