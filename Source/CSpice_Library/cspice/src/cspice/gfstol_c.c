-Brief_I/O

   Variable  I/O  Description
   --------  ---  --------------------------------------------------
   value      I   Double precision value returned or to store.

-Detailed_Input

   value        The scalar double precision value to use as the GF subsystem
                convergence tolerance. This value will override the default
                tolerance, SPICE_GF_CNVTOL, defined in SpiceGF.h Units are
                TDB seconds.

-Detailed_Output

   None.

-Parameters

   None.

-Exceptions

   1)  The error SPICE(INVALIDTOL) signals if 'value' is not strictly
       greater-than-zero.

-Files

   None.

-Particulars

   The high level GF routines (see GF.REQ for a listing) use a
   default value for the convergence tolerance, SPICE_GF_CNVTOL,
   defined in SpiceGF.h. It may occur that a GF search run needs a
   different convergence tolerance. gfstol_c programmatically changes
   the tolerance used by those routines.

-Examples

   The numerical results shown for these examples may differ across
   platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as
   input, the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine
   specific arithmetic implementation.

      Use the meta-kernel shown below to load the required SPICE
      kernels.

         File name: standard.tm

         This meta-kernel is intended to support operation of SPICE
         example programs. The kernels shown here should not be
         assumed to contain adequate or correct versions of data
         required by SPICE-based user applications.

         In order for an application to use this meta-kernel, the
         kernels referenced here must be present in the user's
         current working directory.

         The names and contents of the kernels referenced
         by this meta-kernel are as follows:

            File name                     Contents

            Perform the search. 'et[0]' and 'et[1]' have values ~-6*10^10,
            SPICE_GF_CNVTOL has value 10^-6, so double precision addition or
            subtraction of 'et[0]' and 'et[1]' with SPICE_GF_CNVTOL returns
            a result indistinguishable from 'et[0]' and 'et[1]'.

            Reduce the GF convergence tolerance by an order of magnitude
            to resolve this condition.
