-Detailed_Input
 
   handle         the handle of an EK file that is open for writing. 
                  A "begin segment for fast write" operation must 
                  have already been performed for the designated 
                  segment. 
 
   segno          is the number of the segment to which data is to be
                  added. Segments are numbered from 0 to nseg-1, where
                  nseg is the count of segments in the file.
 
   column         is the name of the column to be added.  All of 
                  the data for the named column will be added in 
                  one shot. 
 
   dvals          is an array containing the entire set of column 
                  entries for the specified column.  The entries 
                  are listed in row-order:  the column entry for the 
                  first row of the segment is first, followed by the 
                  column entry for the second row, and so on.  The 
                  number of column entries must match the declared 
                  number of rows in the segment.  For columns having 
                  fixed-size entries, a null entry must be allocated 
                  the same amount of space occupied by a non-null 
                  entry in the array dvals.  For columns having 
                  variable-size entries, null entries do not require 
                  any space in the dvals* array, but in any case must 
                  have their allocated space described correctly by 
                  the corresponding element of the entszs array 
                  (described below). 
 
   entszs         is an array containing sizes of column entries. 
                  The Ith element of entszs gives the size of the 
                  Ith column entry.  entszs is used only for columns 
                  having variable-size entries.  For such columns, 
                  the dimension of entszs must be at least nrows. 
                  The size of null entries should be set to zero. 
 
                  For columns having fixed-size entries, the 
                  dimension of this array may be any positive value. 
 
   nlflgs         is an array of logical flags indicating whether 
                  the corresponding entries are null.  If the Ith 
                  element of nlflgs is SPICEFALSE, the Ith column entry 
                  defined by dvals and entszs is added to the 
                  current segment in the specified kernel file. 
 
                  If the Ith element of nlfgls is SPICETRUE, the 
                  contents of the Ith column entry are undefined. 
 
                  nlflgs is used only for columns that allow null 
                  values; it's ignored for other columns. 
 
   rcptrs         is an array of record pointers for the input 
                  segment.  This array is obtained as an output 
                  from ekifld_c, the routine called to initiate a 
                  fast write. 
 
   wkindx         is a work space array used for building a column 
                  index.  If the column is indexed, the dimension of 
                  wkindx_c must be at nrows, where nrows is the number 
                  of rows in the column.  If the column is not 
                  indexed, this work space is not used, so the 
                  dimension may be any positive value. 
 
-Detailed_Output
 
   None.  See $Particulars for a description of the effect of this 
   routine. 
 
-Parameters
 
   None. 
 
-Exceptions
 
   1)  If handle is invalid, the error will be diagnosed by routines 
       called by this routine. 
 
   2)  If column is not the name of a declared column, the error will 
       be diagnosed by routines called by this routine. 
 
   3)  If column specifies a column of whose data type is not 
       double precision, the error SPICE(WRONGDATATYPE) will be 
       signaled. 
 
   4)  If the specified column already contains ANY entries, the 
       error will be diagnosed by routines called by this routine. 
 
   5)  If an I/O error occurs while reading or writing the indicated 
       file, the error will be diagnosed by routines called by this 
       routine. 
   
   6) If the string pointer for column is null, the error 
      SPICE(NULLPOINTER) will be signaled.
      
   7) If the input string column has length zero, the error 
      SPICE(EMPTYSTRING) will be signaled.
 
-Files
 
   See the EK Required Reading for a discussion of the EK file 
   format. 
 
-Particulars
 
   This routine operates by side effects:  it modifies the named 
   EK file by adding data to the specified column.  This routine 
   writes the entire contents of the specified column in one shot. 
   This routine creates columns much more efficiently than can be 
   done by sequential calls to ekaced_c, but has the drawback that 
   the caller must use more memory for the routine's inputs.  This 
   routine cannot be used to add data to a partially completed 
   column. 
 
-Examples
 
   1)  Suppose we have an E-kernel named order_db.ek which contains 
       records of orders for data products.  The E-kernel has a 
       table called DATAORDERS that consists of the set of columns 
       listed below: 
 
          DATAORDERS 
 
             Column Name     Data Type 
             -----------     --------- 
             ORDER_ID        INTEGER 
             CUSTOMER_ID     INTEGER 
             LAST_NAME       CHARACTER*(*) 
             FIRST_NAME      CHARACTER*(*) 
             ORDER_DATE      TIME 
             COST            DOUBLE PRECISION 
 
       The order database also has a table of items that have been 
       ordered.  The columns of this table are shown below: 
 
          DATAITEMS 
 
             Column Name     Data Type 
             -----------     --------- 
             ITEM_ID         INTEGER 
             ORDER_ID        INTEGER 
             ITEM_NAME       CHARACTER*(*) 
             DESCRIPTION     CHARACTER*(*) 
             PRICE           DOUBLE PRECISION 
 
 
       We'll suppose that the file ORDER_DB.EK contains two segments, 
       the first containing the DATAORDERS table and the second 
       containing the DATAITEMS table. 
 
       Below, we show how we'd open a new EK file and create the 
       first of the segments described above.

          Open a new EK file.  For simplicity, we will not 
          reserve any space for the comment area, so the

          Set up the table and column names and declarations 
          for the DATAORDERS segment.  We'll index all of 
          the columns.  All columns are scalar, so we omit 
          the size declaration.  Only the COST column may take 
          null values.

          /.
          Start the segment.  We presume the number of  rows 
          of data is known in advance. 
          ./
          ekifld_c ( handle,  TABLE,   NCOLS,  NROWS,   CNMLEN,  
                     cnames,  DECLEN,  cdecls, &segno,  rcptrs );
       
          /.
          At this point, arrays containing data for the 
          segment's columns may be filled in.  The names 
          of the data arrays are shown below. 
       
             Column           Data array 
       
             "ORDER_ID"       ordids

             "ORDER_DATE"     odates 
             "COST"           costs 
       
       
          The null flags array indicates which entries are null. 
          It is ignored for columns that don't allow null 
          values.  In this case, only the COST column allows 
          nulls. 
          
          Fill in data arrays and null flag arrays here.  This code
          section would normally be replaced by calls to user functions
          returning column values.
          ./
          
          for ( i = 0;  i < NROWS;  i++ )
          {
             ordids[i]  =  i;
             cstids[i]  =  i*100;
             costs [i]  =  (SpiceDouble) 100*i;
       
             sprintf  ( fnames[i], "Order %d Customer first name", i );
             sprintf  ( lnames[i], "Order %d Customer last name",  i );
             sprintf  ( dateStr,   "1998 Mar %d",                  i );
             
             utc2et_c ( dateStr, ets+i );
       
             nlflgs[i]  =  SPICEFALSE;
          }
       
          nlflgs[1] = SPICETRUE;
          
          
          /.
          The sizes array shown below is ignored for scalar 
          and fixed-size array columns, so we need not 
          initialize it.  For variable-size arrays, the 
          Ith element of the sizes array must contain the size 
          of the Ith column entry in the column being written. 
          Normally, the sizes array would be reset for each 
          variable-size column. 
       
          Add the columns of data to the segment.  All of the 
          data for each column is written in one shot. 
          ./
          ekacli_c ( handle,  segno,   "order_id",    ordids, 
                     sizes,   nlflgs,  rcptrs,        wkindx ); 
       
          ekacli_c ( handle,  segno,   "customer_id", cstids,  
                     sizes,   nlflgs,  rcptrs,        wkindx ); 
       
          ekaclc_c ( handle,  segno,   "last_name",   LNMLEN,
                     lnames,  sizes,   nlflgs,        rcptrs,  wkindx ); 
       
          ekaclc_c ( handle,  segno,   "first_name",  FNMLEN,
                     fnames,  sizes,   nlflgs,        rcptrs,  wkindx ); 
       
          ekacld_c ( handle,  segno,   "order_date",  ets,  
                     sizes,   nlflgs,  rcptrs,        wkindx );
          
          ekacld_c ( handle,  segno,   "cost",        costs,  
                     sizes,   nlflgs,  rcptrs,        wkindx ); 
       
          /.
          Complete the segment.  The rcptrs array is that 
          returned by ekifld_c. 
          ./
          ekffld_c ( handle, segno, rcptrs ); 
       
          /.
          At this point, the second segment could be 
          created by an analogous process.  In fact, the 
          second segment could be created at any time; it is 
          not necessary to populate the first segment with 
          data before starting the second segment. 
       
          The file must be closed by a call to ekcls_c. 
          ./
          ekcls_c ( handle ); 
       }

 
-Restrictions
 
   1)  Only one segment can be created at a time using the fast

   2)  No other EK operation may interrupt a fast write.  For 
       example, it is not valid to issue a query while a fast write 
       is in progress.

-Version

   -CSPICE Version 1.1.2, 14-AUG-2006   (EDW)

      Replace mention of ldpool_c with furnsh_c.
 
   -CSPICE Version 1.1.1, 09-JAN-2002 (NJB)

      Documentation change:  instances of the phrase "fast load"
      were replaced with "fast write."

   -CSPICE Version 1.1.0, 07-JUL-1998 (NJB)

       Bug fix:  now uses dynamically allocated array of type logical
       to interface with underlying f2c'd function ekacld_.
       
       Now maps segno from C to Fortran range.
       
       Added "undef" of masking macro.  Changed input pointer types
       to pointers to const objects.
       
   -CSPICE Version 1.0.0, 01-APR-1998 (NJB)

       Based on SPICELIB Version 1.0.0, 08-NOV-1995 (NJB)
