/*     Note:  The column descriptor size parameter CDSCSZ  is */
/*     declared separately in the include section CDSIZE$INC.FOR. */

/*     Offset of column descriptors, relative to start of segment */
/*     integer address range.  This number, when added to the last */
/*     integer address preceding the segment, yields the DAS integer */
/*     base address of the first column descriptor.  Currently, this */
/*     offset is exactly the size of a segment descriptor.  The */
/*     parameter SDSCSZ, which defines the size of a segment descriptor, */
/*     is declared in the include file eksegdsc.inc. */


/*     Size of column descriptor */


/*     Indices of various pieces of column descriptors: */


/*     CLSIDX is the index of the column's class code.  (We use the */
/*     word `class' to distinguish this item from the column's data */
/*     type.) */


/*     TYPIDX is the index of the column's data type code (CHR, INT, DP, */
/*     or TIME).  The type is actually implied by the class, but it */
/*     will frequently be convenient to look up the type directly. */



/*     LENIDX is the index of the column's string length value, if the */
/*     column has character type.  A value of IFALSE in this element of */
/*     the descriptor indicates that the strings have variable length. */


/*     SIZIDX is the index of the column's element size value.  This */
/*     descriptor element is meaningful for columns with fixed-size */
/*     entries.  For variable-sized columns, this value is IFALSE. */


/*     NAMIDX is the index of the base address of the column's name. */


/*     IXTIDX is the data type of the column's index.  IXTIDX */
/*     contains a type value only if the column is indexed. For columns */
/*     that are not indexed, the location IXTIDX contains the boolean */
/*     value IFALSE. */


/*     IXPIDX is a pointer to the column's index.  IXTPDX contains a */
/*     meaningful value only if the column is indexed.  The */
/*     interpretation of the pointer depends on the data type of the */
/*     index. */


/*     NFLIDX is the index of a flag indicating whether nulls are */
/*     permitted in the column.  The value at location NFLIDX is */
/*     ITRUE if nulls are permitted and IFALSE otherwise. */


/*     ORDIDX is the index of the column's ordinal position in the */
/*     list of columns belonging to the column's parent segment. */


/*     METIDX is the index of the column's integer metadata pointer. */
/*     This pointer is a DAS integer address. */


/*     The last position in the column descriptor is reserved.  No */
/*     parameter is defined to point to this location. */

/*     --------  ---  -------------------------------------------------- */
/*     HANDLE     I   File handle. */
/*     COLDSC     I   Column descriptor. */

/* $ Detailed_Input */

/*     HANDLE         is a file handle of an EK that is open for write */
/*                    access. */

/*     COLDSC         is the column descriptor of the column for */
/*                    which the index is to be created. */

/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*     None.  See $Particulars for a description of the effect of this */
/*     routine. */

/* $ Parameters */

/*     None. */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*     1)  If HANDLE is invalid, the error will be diagnosed by routines */
/*         called by this routine. */

/*     2)  If an I/O error occurs while reading or writing the indicated */
/*         file, the error will be diagnosed by routines called by this */
/*         routine. */

/* $ Files */

/*     See the EK Required Reading for a discussion of the EK file */
/*     format. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     This routine operates by side effects:  it creates a new, empty */
/*     type 1 index for a specified EK column.  Though this routine */
/*     does not require a segment to be specified, normally indexes */
/*     are created for columns belonging to specific segments. */

/*     Type 1 indexes are implemented as DAS B*-trees.  The data */
/*     pointers of an index tree contain record numbers.  Therefore, the */
/*     tree implements an abstract order vector. */

/*     In order to support the capability of creating an index for a */
/*     column that has already been populated with data, this routine */
/*     does not check that the specified column is empty.  The caller */
/*     must populate the index appropriately to reflect the order of */
/*     elements in the associated column. */
