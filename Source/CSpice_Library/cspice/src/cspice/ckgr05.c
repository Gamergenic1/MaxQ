/* $ Parameters */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*     2)  If RECNO is less than one or greater than the number of */
/*         records in the specified segment, the error */
/*         SPICE(CKNONEXISTREC) is signaled. */

/*     3)  If the specified handle does not belong to any DAF file that */
/*         is currently known to be open, an error is diagnosed by a */
/*         routine that this routine calls. */

/*     4)  If DESCR is not a valid descriptor of a segment in the CK */
/*         file specified by HANDLE, the results of this routine are */
/*         unpredictable. */

/*     5)  If the segment subtype is not recognized, the error */
/*         SPICE(NOTSUPPORTED) is signaled. */

/* $ Files */

/*     The file specified by HANDLE should be open for read or */
/*     write access. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     For a detailed description of the structure of a type 5 segment, */
/*     see the CK required reading. */

/*     This is a utility routine that may be used to read the individual */
/*     pointing instances that make up a type 5 segment.  It is normally */
/*     used in conjunction with CKNR05, which gives the number of */
/*     pointing instances stored in a segment. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     Suppose that MOC.BC is a CK file that contains segments of */
/*     data type 5.  Then the following code fragment extracts the */
