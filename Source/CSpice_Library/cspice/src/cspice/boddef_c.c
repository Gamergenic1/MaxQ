-Brief_I/O

   Variable  I/O  Description
   --------  ---  --------------------------------------------------
   name       I   Common name of some body.
   code       I   Integer code for that body.

-Detailed_Input

   name        is an arbitrary name of a body which could be
               a planet, satellite, barycenter, spacecraft,
               asteroid, comet, or other ephemeris object.

               The case and positions of blanks in a name are
               significant. bodc2n_c returns the same string
               (case and space) most recently mapped to a code.
               When 'name' consists of more than one word, the
               words require separation by at least one blank.

               The kernel sub-system stores 'name' as described in
               the boddef_c call, but creates an equivalence class
               based on 'name for comparisons in bodn2c_c. This class
               ignores leading/trailing whitespace, compresses
               interior whitespace to a single space, and ignores 
               character case.

               The following strings belong to the same equivalence 
               class:

                       "JUPITER BARYCENTER"
                       "Jupiter Barycenter"
                       "JUPITER BARYCENTER   "
                       "JUPITER    BARYCENTER"
                       "   JUPITER BARYCENTER"

               However, "JUPITERBARYCENTER" is distinct from
               the names above.

               When ignoring trailing blanks, NAME must be short
               enough to fit into the space defined by parameter
               MAXL.The value may be found in the C file 
               zzbodtrn.c. Due to the way in which f2c converts 
               FORTRAN code to C, you must examine the dimensions
               assigned to the variables:
 
                   defnam
                   defnor
                   kernam
                   kernor

                to obtain the MAXL value. These variables have a 
                declaration of the form:

                   static char variable_name[MAXL*array_length]
                
                  (note MAXL is this first value).

               The maximum allowed length of a name is in any case
               at least 32 characters. 

   code        is the integer ID code for assignment to body 'name'.

-Detailed_Output

   None.

-Parameters

   None.

-Exceptions

   1) An attempt to associate more than one code with a given name
      will cause an error to be signaled by a routine called by this
      routine.

   2) Names too long to be stored will be truncated on the right.
      Names of length not exceeding 32 characters will not be
      truncated.

-Files

   None.

-Particulars

   boddef_c is one of five related subroutines,

      bods2c_c      Body string to code
      bodc2s_c      Body code to string
      bodn2c_c      Body name to code
      bodc2n_c      Body code to name
      boddef_c      Body name/code definition

   bods2c_c, bodc2s_c, bodn2c_c, and bodc2n_c perform translations between 
   body names and their corresponding integer ID codes which are 
   used in SPICE files and routines.

   bods2c_c is a slightly more general version of bodn2c_c: support
   for strings containing ID codes in string format enables a caller
   to identify a body using a string, even when no name is
   associated with that body.

   bodc2s_c is a general version of bodc2n_c; the routine returns either
   the name assigned in the body ID to name mapping or a string
   representation of the CODE value if no mapping exists.

   boddef_c assigns a body name to ID mapping. The mapping has priority 
   in name-to-ID and ID-to-name translations.

   Refer to NAIF_IDs for the list of name/code associations built into
   SPICE, and for details concerning adding new name/code
   associations at run time by loading text kernels.

   Modifying the SPICE name-ID mapping set
   =======================================

   Each body has a unique integer 'code', but may have several
   names. Thus you may associate more than one name with
   a particular integer code.

   'code' may already have a name as defined by a previous
   call to boddef_c or as part of the set of default
   definitions.  That previous definition will remain,
   and a translation of that name will still give the
   same 'code'.  However, future translations of 'code' will
   give the new 'name' instead of the previous one.  This
   feature is useful for assigning a more familiar or
   abbreviated name to a body. For example, in addition
   to the default name for body 5, "JUPITER BARYCENTER",
   you could define the abbreviation "JB" to mean 5.

   Note: In the case where boddef_c performs a name-to-ID mapping
   assignment for an unused body name and unused ID value,
   any subsequent assignment to NAME destroys the previous
   mapping.

      boddef_c ( "spud", 22)

   then

      boddef_c ( "spud", 23)

   results in the state "spud" maps to 23, 23 maps to "spud",
   and 22 maps to nothing ('found' in bodc2n_c returns SPICEFALSE).

-Examples

   You may associate a new name with a particular code that
   has already been defined:

          boddef_c ( "JB", 5 );

   You may also define the name and integer code for a new body:

          boddef_c ( "Asteroid Frank", 20103456 );

   After these calls to boddef_c, bodn2c_c would return the following
   translations:

      Name                         Code    Found?
      ------------------------   ------    ------
      "JB"                            5    Yes
      "Jupiter Barycenter"            5    Yes
      "ASTEROID FRANK"         20103456    Yes
      "ASTEROIDFRANK"                 -    No
      "Frank"                         -    No

   and BODC2N will return these translations:

      Code        Name                     Found?
      -------     -------------------      ------
             5    "JB"                     Yes
      20103456    "Asteroid Frank"         Yes

-Version

   -CSPICE Version 2.2.2, 16-MAY-2009 (EDW) 

       Edit to Particulars section to document the bodc2s_c routine.

   -CSPICE Version 2.2.1, 27-FEB-2008 (BVS)

       Corrected the contents of the Required_Reading section of 
       the header.

   -CSPICE Version 2.2.0, 23-JAN-2004 (EDW)

      Updated header to describe the maximum allowed length
      for 'name' and its effect on this module.

      Updated header with information on new functionality.
      The code-to-name retrieval routines now return the exact
      string as defined in the last code/name mapping (case
      and space).

       ConstSpiceChar *.

       References to C2F_CreateStr_Sig were removed; code was
       cleaned up accordingly.  String checks are now done using
       the macro CHKFSTR.
