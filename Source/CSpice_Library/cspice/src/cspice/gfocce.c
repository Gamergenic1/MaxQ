/*         Step sizes that are too large may cause this routine to miss */
/*         roots; step sizes that are too small may cause this routine */

/*         This routine does not diagnose invalid step sizes, except */
/*         that if the step size is non-positive, the error */

/*     2)  Due to numerical errors, in particular, */

/*            - Truncation error in time values */
/*            - Finite tolerance value */
/*            - Errors in computed geometric quantities */

/*         it is *normal* for the condition of interest to not always be */
/*         satisfied near the endpoints of the intervals comprising the */
/*         result window. */

/*         The result window may need to be contracted slightly by the */
/*         caller to achieve desired results. The SPICE window routine */
/*         WNCOND can be used to contract the result window. */

/*     3)  If name of either target or the observer cannot be translated */
/*         to a NAIF ID code, the error SPICE(IDCODENOTFOUND) is */
/*         signaled. */

/*     4)  If the radii of a target body modeled as an ellipsoid cannot */
/*         be determined by searching the kernel pool for a kernel */

/*         call tree of this routine. */

/*     5)  If either of the target bodies FRONT or BACK coincides with */
/*         the observer body OBSRVR, the error SPICE(BODIESNOTDISTINCT) */
/*         will be signaled. */

/*     6)  If the body designated by FRONT coincides with that */

/*     8)  If both of the body model specifiers FSHAPE and BSHAPE */
/*         specify point targets, the error SPICE(INVALIDSHAPECOMBO) */
/*         will be signaled. */

/*     9)  If a target body-fixed reference frame associated with a */

/*     10) If a target body-fixed reference frame is not centered at */
/*         the corresponding target body,  the error will be */
/*         diagnosed by a routine in the call tree of this routine. */

/*     11) If the loaded kernels provide insufficient data to */
/*         compute the requested state vector, the deficiency will */
/*         be diagnosed by a routine in the call tree of this routine. */

/*     12) If an error occurs while reading an SPK or other kernel file, */
/*         the error will be diagnosed by a routine in the call tree */
/*         of this routine. */

/*     13) If a point target is specified and the occultation */
/*         type is set to a valid value other than 'ANY', the */
/*         error SPICE(BADTYPESHAPECOMBO) will be signaled. */

/*     14) If the output SPICE window RESULT has insufficient capacity */
/*         to contain the number of intervals on which the specified */
/*         visibility condition is met, the error will be diagnosed */
/*         by a routine in the call tree of this routine. If the result */
/*         window has size less than 2, the error SPICE(WINDOWTOOSMALL) */
/*         will be signaled by this routine. */

/*     15) Invalid occultation types will be diagnosed by a routine in */
/*         the call tree of this routine. */

/*     16) Invalid aberration correction specifications will be */
/*         diagnosed by a routine in the call tree of this routine. */

/*     17) If the convergence tolerance size is non-positive, the error */
/*         SPICE(INVALIDTOLERANCE) will be signaled. */

/*     18) If either FSHAPE or BSHAPE specifies that the target surface */
/*         is represented by DSK data, and no DSK files are loaded for */
/*         the specified target, the error is signaled by a routine in */
/*         the call tree of this routine. */

/*     19) If either FSHAPE or BSHAPE specifies that the target surface */
/*         is represented by DSK data, but the shape specification is */
/*         invalid, the error is signaled by a routine in the call tree */
/*         of this routine. */

/*          period specified by the window CNFINE. If aberration */
/*          corrections are used, the states of the target bodies and of */
/*          the observer relative to the solar system barycenter must be */
/*          calculable from the available ephemeris data. Typically */
/*          ephemeris data */
/*          are made available by loading one or more SPK files via */
/*          FURNSH. */

/*        - PCK data: bodies modeled as triaxial ellipsoids must have */
/*          semi-axis lengths provided by variables in the kernel pool. */
/*          Typically these data are made available by loading a text */

/*        - FK data: if either of the reference frames designated by */

/*        - Surface name-ID associations: if surface names are specified */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     This routine provides the SPICE GF system's most flexible */
/*     interface for searching for occultation events. */

/*     Applications that require do not require support for progress */
/*     reporting, interrupt handling, non-default step or refinement */
/*     functions, or non-default convergence tolerance normally should */
/*     call GFOCLT rather than this routine. */

/*     This routine determines a set of one or more time intervals */
/*     within the confinement window when a specified type of */
/*     occultation occurs. The resulting set of intervals is returned as */
/*     a SPICE window. */

/*     Below we discuss in greater detail aspects of this routine's */
/*     solution process that are relevant to correct and efficient */
/*     use of this routine in user applications. */


/*     The Search Process */
/*     ================== */

/*     The search for occultations is treated as a search for state */
/*     transitions: times are sought when the state of the BACK body */
/*     changes from "not occulted" to "occulted" or vice versa. */

/*     Step Size */
/*     ========= */

/*     Each interval of the confinement window is searched as follows: */
/*     first, the input step size is used to determine the time */
/*     separation at which the occultation state will be sampled. */
/*     Starting at the left endpoint of an interval, samples will be */
/*     taken at each step. If a state change is detected, a root has */
/*     been bracketed; at that point, the "root"--the time at which the */
/*     state change occurs---is found by a refinement process, for */
/*     example, via binary search. */

/*     Note that the optimal choice of step size depends on the lengths */
/*     of the intervals over which the occultation state is constant: */
/*     the step size should be shorter than the shortest occultation */
/*     duration and the shortest period between occultations, within */
/*     the confinement window. */

/*     Having some knowledge of the relative geometry of the targets and */
/*     observer can be a valuable aid in picking a reasonable step size. */
/*     In general, the user can compensate for lack of such knowledge by */
/*     picking a very short step size; the cost is increased computation */
/*     time. */

/*     Note that the step size is not related to the precision with which */
/*     the endpoints of the intervals of the result window are computed. */
/*     That precision level is controlled by the convergence tolerance. */


/*     Convergence Tolerance */
/*     ===================== */

/*     Once a root has been bracketed, a refinement process is used to */
/*     narrow down the time interval within which the root must lie. */
/*     This refinement process terminates when the location of the root */
/*     has been determined to within an error margin called the */
/*     "convergence tolerance." */

/*     The convergence tolerance used by high-level GF routines that */
/*     call this routine is set via the parameter CNVTOL, which is */
/*     declared in the INCLUDE file gf.inc. The value of CNVTOL is set */
/*     to a "tight" value so that the tolerance doesn't become the */
/*     limiting factor in the accuracy of solutions found by this */
/*     routine. In general the accuracy of input data will be the */
/*     limiting factor. */

/*     Setting the input tolerance TOL tighter than CNVTOL is unlikely */
/*     to be useful, since the results are unlikely to be more accurate. */
/*     Making the tolerance looser will speed up searches somewhat, */
/*     since a few convergence steps will be omitted. However, in most */
/*     cases, the step size is likely to have a much greater effect on */
/*     processing time than would the convergence tolerance. */


/*     The Confinement Window */
/*     ====================== */

/*     The simplest use of the confinement window is to specify a time */
/*     interval within which a solution is sought. However, the */
/*     confinement window can, in some cases, be used to make searches */
/*     more efficient. Sometimes it's possible to do an efficient search */
/*     to reduce the size of the time period over which a relatively */
/*     slow search of interest must be performed. For an example, see */
/*     the program CASCADE in the GF Example Programs chapter of the GF */
/*     Required Reading, gf.req. */


/*     Using DSK data */
/*     ============== */

/*        DSK loading and unloading */
/*        ------------------------- */

/*        DSK files providing data used by this routine are loaded by */
/*        calling FURNSH and can be unloaded by calling UNLOAD or */
/*        KCLEAR. See the documentation of FURNSH for limits on numbers */
/*        of loaded DSK files. */

/*        For run-time efficiency, it's desirable to avoid frequent */
/*        loading and unloading of DSK files. When there is a reason to */
/*        use multiple versions of data for a given target body---for */
/*        example, if topographic data at varying resolutions are to be */
/*        used---the surface list can be used to select DSK data to be */
/*        used for a given computation. It is not necessary to unload */
/*        the data that are not to be used. This recommendation presumes */
/*        that DSKs containing different versions of surface data for a */
/*        given body have different surface ID codes. */


/*        DSK data priority */
/*        ----------------- */

/*        A DSK coverage overlap occurs when two segments in loaded DSK */
/*        files cover part or all of the same domain---for example, a */
/*        given longitude-latitude rectangle---and when the time */
/*        intervals of the segments overlap as well. */

/*        When DSK data selection is prioritized, in case of a coverage */
/*        overlap, if the two competing segments are in different DSK */
/*        files, the segment in the DSK file loaded last takes */
/*        precedence. If the two segments are in the same file, the */
/*        segment located closer to the end of the file takes */
/*        precedence. */

/*        When DSK data selection is unprioritized, data from competing */
/*        segments are combined. For example, if two competing segments */
/*        both represent a surface as sets of triangular plates, the */
/*        union of those sets of plates is considered to represent the */
/*        surface. */

/*        Currently only unprioritized data selection is supported. */
/*        Because prioritized data selection may be the default behavior */
/*        in a later version of the routine, the UNPRIORITIZED keyword is */
/*        required in the FSHAPE and BSHAPE arguments. */


/*        Syntax of the shape input arguments for the DSK case */
/*        ---------------------------------------------------- */

/*        The keywords and surface list in the target shape arguments */
/*        FSHAPE and BSHAPE, when DSK shape models are specified, are */
/*        called "clauses." The clauses may appear in any order, for */
/*        example */

/*           DSK/<surface list>/UNPRIORITIZED */
/*           DSK/UNPRIORITIZED/<surface list> */
/*           UNPRIORITIZED/<surface list>/DSK */

/*        The simplest form of a target argument specifying use of */
/*        DSK data is one that lacks a surface list, for example: */

/*           'DSK/UNPRIORITIZED' */

/*        For applications in which all loaded DSK data for the target */
/*        body are for a single surface, and there are no competing */
/*        segments, the above string suffices. This is expected to be */
/*        the usual case. */

/*        When, for the specified target body, there are loaded DSK */
/*        files providing data for multiple surfaces for that body, the */
/*        surfaces to be used by this routine for a given call must be */
/*        specified in a surface list, unless data from all of the */
/*        surfaces are to be used together. */

/*        The surface list consists of the string */

/*           SURFACES = */

/*        followed by a comma-separated list of one or more surface */
/*        identifiers. The identifiers may be names or integer codes in */
/*        string format. For example, suppose we have the surface */
/*        names and corresponding ID codes shown below: */

/*           Surface Name                              ID code */
/*           ------------                              ------- */
/*           'Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG'                1 */
/*           'Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG'                 2 */
/*           'Mars_MRO_HIRISE'                         3 */

/*        If data for all of the above surfaces are loaded, then */
/*        data for surface 1 can be specified by either */

/*           'SURFACES = 1' */

/*        or */

/*           'SURFACES = "Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG"' */

/*        Double quotes are used to delimit the surface name because */
/*        it contains blank characters. */

/*        To use data for surfaces 2 and 3 together, any */
/*        of the following surface lists could be used: */

/*           'SURFACES = 2, 3' */

/*           'SURFACES = "Mars MEGDR  64 PIXEL/DEG", 3' */

/*           'SURFACES = 2, Mars_MRO_HIRISE' */

/*           'SURFACES = "Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG", Mars_MRO_HIRISE' */

/*        An example of a shape argument that could be constructed */
/*        using one of the surface lists above is */

/*              'DSK/UNPRIORITIZED/SURFACES = ' */
/*           // '"Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG", 499003' */

/*     The numerical results shown for these examples may differ across */
/*     platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as */
/*     input, the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine */
/*     specific arithmetic implementation. */
