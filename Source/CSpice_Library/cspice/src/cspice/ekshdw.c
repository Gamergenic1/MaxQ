/* $ Detailed_Input */

/*     HANDLE         is the file handle of an EK open for writing. */

/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*     ISSHAD         is a logical flag that is returned .TRUE. if and */
/*                    only if the EK file designated by HANDLE is */

/* $ Parameters */

/*     None. */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*     Error free. */

/*     1)  It is not an error to supply an input handle that does not */
/*         belong to an EK that is open for write access. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     This routine is a utility that allows a program to test the */
