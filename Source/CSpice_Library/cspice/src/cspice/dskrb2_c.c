-Detailed_Input
 
   nv          is the number of vertices belonging to the input 
               set of plates. 
 
  
   vrtces      is an array of coordinates of the vertices. The Ith 
               vertex occupies elements [I-1][0:2] of this array. 
 
 
   np          is the number of plates in the input plate set. 
 
 
   plates      is an array representing the triangular plates of a 
               shape model. The elements of `plates' are vertex 
               indices; vertex indices are 1-based. The vertex 
               indices of the Ith plate occupy elements [I-1][0:2] of 
               this array. 
 
   corsys      is an integer parameter identifying the coordinate 
               system in which the bounds are to be computed. The 
               bounds apply to the third coordinate in each system: 
 
                  Latitudinal:           radius 
                  Planetodetic:          altitude 
                  Rectangular:           Z 
 
 
   corpar     is an array of parameters associated with the coordinate 
              system. Currently the only supported system that has 
              associated parameters is the planetodetic system. For 
              planetodetic coordinates, 
 
                 corpar[0] is the equatorial radius 
 
                 corpar[1] is the flattening coefficient. Let `re' and 
                 `rp' represent, respectively, the equatorial and 
                 polar radii of the reference ellipsoid of the 
                 system. Then 
 
                     corpar[1] = ( re - rp ) / re 
 
-Detailed_Output
 
   mncor3    is a lower bound on the range of the third coordinate 
             of the system identified by `corsys' and `corpar', taken 
             over all plates. 
 
             For latitudinal and rectangular coordinates, `mncor3' 
             is the greatest lower bound of the third coordinate. 
 
             For planetodetic coordinates, `mncor3' is an 
             approximation: it is less than or equal to the greatest 
             lower bound. 
 
   mxcor3    is the least upper bound on the range of the third 
             coordinate of the system identified by `corsys' and 
             `corpar', taken over all plates. 
 
 
-Parameters
 
   See the include file dskdsc.inc for declarations of the public DSK 
   type 2 parameters used by this routine. 
 
-Exceptions
 
   1)  If the input coordinate system is not recognized, the error
       SPICE(NOTSUPPORTED) is signaled.

   2)  If a conversion from rectangular to planetodetic coordinates 
       fails, the error will be signaled by a routine in the call 
       tree of this routine. 
 
-Files
 
   None. 
 
-Particulars
 
   Users planning to create DSK files should consider whether the  
   SPICE DSK creation utility MKDSK may be suitable for their needs. 
 
   This routine supports use of the DSK type 2 segment writer dskw02_c 
   by computing bounds on the range of the third coordinates of
   the input plate set.
 
-Examples
 
   The numerical results shown for this example may differ across 
   platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as 
   input, the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine  
   specific arithmetic implementation.  
 
   1) Create a three-segment DSK file using plate model data for 
      Phobos. Use latitudinal, rectangular, and planetodetic 
      coordinates in the respective segments. This is not a  
      realistic example, but it serves to demonstrate use of  
      the supported coordinate systems. 
 
      For simplicity, use an existing DSK file to provide the  
      input plate and vertex data. The selected input file has one 
      segment. 
 
 
      Example code begins here.

-Restrictions
 
   1)  For planetodetic coordinates, the computation of the lower
       altitude bound requires that the surface at altitude `mncor3' be
       convex. This is the case for realistic geometries, but can be
       false if a plate is very large compared to the overall shape
       model.
