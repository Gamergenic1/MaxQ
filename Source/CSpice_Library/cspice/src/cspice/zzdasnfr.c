/* $ Detailed_Input */

/*     LUN        is a logical unit number of a DAS whose first record is */
/*                to be created with a DAS file record bearing the */
/*                attributes specified by the other arguments. */

/*     IDWORD     is the 'ID word' contained in the first eight */
/*                characters of the file record. */

/*     IFNAME     is the internal file name of the DAS file.  The */
/*                maximum length of the internal file name is 60 */
/*                characters. */

/*     NRESVR     is the number of reserved records in the DAS file */
/*                specified by HANDLE. */

/*     NRESVC     is the number of characters in use in the reserved */
/*                record area of the DAS file specified by HANDLE. */

/*     NCOMR      is the number of comment records in the DAS file */
/*                specified by HANDLE. */

/*     NCOMC      is the number of characters in use in the comment area */
/*                of the DAS file specified by HANDLE. */

/*     FORMAT     is a character string that indicates what the numeric */
/*                binary format the DAS is utilizing. */

/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*     None. */

/* $ Parameters */

/*     See include file zzftprms.inc. */

/* $ Files */

/*     This routine writes to the first record of the DAS whose */
/*     logical unit is LUN. */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*     1) If any errors occur from the WRITE to the logical unit LUN, */
/*        the error SPICE(DASWRITEFAIL) is signaled.  Before returing */
/*        to the caller, the file attached to LUN is closed and deleted. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     This routine assembles the file record and writes it to the */
/*     first record in a DAS.  Its purpose is to write new file */
/*     records only.  For updates, use DASWFR. */

/*     Make certain the caller checks FAILED() after this returns, */
/*     since on error it closes and deletes the file. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     None. */

/* $ Restrictions */

/*     1) An individual character must occupy 1 byte of space and */
/*        conform to the ASCII standard. */

/*     2) The word size for the machine should be at least 32 bits, */
/*        else the computations to null pad the gaps in the file */
/*        record may overstep record boundaries. */
