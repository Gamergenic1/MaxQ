/*     UNIT     The Fortran unit number for a previously opened text */
/*              file. All writing will begin at the CURRENT POSITION */
/*              in the text file. */

/*     DATA     List of integers to be encoded and written to the text */
/*              file attached to UNIT. */

/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*     See the Particulars section for a description of the effect of */
/*     this routine. */

/* $ Parameters */

/*      None. */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*     1)   If N, the number of data items, is not positive, the error */
/*          SPICE(INVALIDARGUMENT) will be signalled. */

/*     2)   If an error occurs while writing to the text file attached */
/*          to UNIT, the error SPICE(FILEWRITEFAILED) will be signalled. */

/*     3)   If the Fortran logical unit UNIT is not defined, the results */
/*          of this routine are unpredictable. */

/* $ Files */

/*     See the description of UNIT in the Detailed_Input section. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     This routine will accept a list of one or more integers which */
/*     it will encode into equivalent text strings and write to the */
/*     current position in a text file. The current position in a file */
/*     is defined to be the text line immediately following the last */
/*     text line that was written or read. The encoded integers are */
/*     written to the output text file as quoted character strings so */
/*     that a Fortran list directed read may be used to read the */
/*     encoded values, rather than a formatted read with the format */
/*     specifier FMT = '(A)'. */

/*     This routine is one of a pair of routines which are used to */
/*     encode and decode integers: */

/*           WRENCI -- Encode and write integers to a file. */
/*           RDENCI -- Read and decode integers from a file. */

/*     The encoding/decoding of integers is performed to provide a */
/*     portable means for transferring data values. */

/*     Currently the text string produced will be a signed hexadecimal */
/*     number See INT2HX.FOR and HX2INT.FOR for details. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     Please note that the output format in the examples is not */
/*     intended to be exactly identical with the output format of this */
/*     routine in actual use. The output format used in the examples is */
/*     intended to aid in the understanding of how this routine works. */
/*     It is NOT intended to be a specification of the output format for */
/*     this routine. */

/*     Let */

/*        UNIT     be the Fortran logical unit of a previously opened */
/*                 text file. */

/*        N        = 100 */

/*        DATA(I)  = I, I = 1, N */

/*     Then, the subroutine call */

/*           CALL WRENCI( UNIT, N, DATA ) */

/*     will write the first 100 integers, encoded, to the output text */
/*     file attached to UNIT, beginning at the current position in the */
/*     output file, which is marked by an arrow, '-->'. The resulting */
/*     output will look something like the following: */

/*        -->'1' '2' '3' '4' '5' '6' '7' '8' '9' 'A' 'B' 'C' 'D' 'E' */
/*           'F' '10' '11' '12' '13' '14' '15' '16' '17' '18' '19' */
/*           '1A' '1B' '1C' '1D' '1E' '1F' '20' '21' '22' '23' '24' */
/*           '25' '26' '27' '28' '29' '2A' '2B' '2C' '2D' '2E' '2F' */
/*           '30' '31' '32' '33' '34' '35' '36' '37' '38' '39' '3A' */
/*           '3B' '3C' '3D' '3E' '3F' '40' */
/*           '41' '42' '43' '44' '45' '46' '47' '48' '49' '4A' '4B' */
/*           '4C' '4D' '4E' '4F' '50' '51' '52' '53' '54' '55' '56' */
/*           '57' '58' '59' '5A' '5B' '5C' '5D' '5E' '5F' '60' '61' */
/*           '62' '63' '64' */
/*        --> */

/*     At this point, the arrow marks the position of the file pointer */
/*     immediately after the call to WRENCI. */

/*        lines on some of the supported systems, such as the NeXT with */
/*        Absoft Fortran 3.2. */

/*        On some of the supported computers this routine would produce */
/*        very long (greater than 1000 characters) output lines due to */
/*        the implicit DO loop used in the WRITE statment: */

/*            WRITE (UNIT,IOSTAT=IOSTAT,FMT=*) */
/*           .   ( QUOTE//WORK(I)(1:LENGTH(I))//QUOTE//' ', I=1,NITMS ) */

/*        This problem was fixed by removing the implicit DO loop from */
/*        the WRITE statement and placing an equivalent DO loop around */
/*        the WRITE statemtent: */

/*            DO I = 1, NITMS */
/*               WRITE (UNIT,IOSTAT=IOSTAT,FMT=*) */
/*           .       QUOTE//WORK(I)(1:LENGTH(I))//QUOTE */
/*            END DO */

/*        The net effect of this will be that only a single datum will */
/*        be written on each line of output. */

/*        A disclaimer was added to the $ Examples section concerning */
