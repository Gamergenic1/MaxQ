/*     POOL       I   A doubly linked list pool. */
/*     LBPOOL     P   Lower bound of pool column indices. */

/*     The function returns the size of the pool. */

/* $ Detailed_Input */

/*     POOL           is a doubly linked list pool. */

/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*     The function returns the size (total number of nodes) of the pool. */

/* $ Parameters */

/*     LBPOOL        is the lower bound of the column indices of the POOL */
/*                   array.  The columns indexed LBPOOL to 0 are reserved */
/*                   as a control area for the pool. */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*     Error free. */

/* $ Files */

/*     None. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     This routine allows an application program to determine the size */
/*     of a doubly linked list pool at run-time, without having to rely */
/*     on knowledge of the internals of the doubly linked list pool */
/*     structure. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     1)  Let POOL be a doubly linked list pool.  The total number of */
/*         nodes in a doubly linked list pool is set when the pool is */
/*         initialized by LNKINI.  This number is returned by LNKSIZ: */

/*            C */
/*            C     This sequence of calls will assign the value 100 */
/*            C     to the variable SIZE: */
/*            C */
/*                  CALL LNKINI ( 100, POOL ) */
/*                  SIZE = LNKSIZ ( POOL ) */

/* $ Restrictions */

/*     Linked list pools must be initialized via the routine */
/*     LNKINI.  Failure to initialize a linked list pool */
/*     will almost certainly lead to confusing results. */

/* $ Literature_References */

/*     None. */

/*     The control area contains 3 elements.  They are: */

/*        The "size" of the pool, that is, the number */
/*        of nodes in the pool. */

/*        The number of free nodes in the pool. */

/*        The "free pointer," which is the column index of the first free */
/*        node. */

/*     Parameters defining the row and column indices of these control */
/*     elements are given below. */


/*     Each assigned node consists of a backward pointer and a forward */
/*     pointer. */

/*        +-------------+       +-------------+       +-------------+ */
/*        |  forward--> |       |  forward--> |       |  forward--> | */
/*        +-------------+  ...  +-------------+  ...  +-------------+ */
/*        | <--backward |       | <--backward |       | <--backward | */
/*        +-------------+       +-------------+       +-------------+ */

/*            node 1                 node I              node SIZE */




/*     Free nodes say that that's what they are.  The way they say it */
/*     is by containing the value FREE in their backward pointers. */
/*     Needless to say, FREE is a value that cannot be a valid pointer. */


/*     Grab the pool size from the control area. */

    ret_val = pool[10];
    return ret_val;
