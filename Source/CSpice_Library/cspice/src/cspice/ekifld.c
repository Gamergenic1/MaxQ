/*     are listed below. */

/*     Integer codes are also used within the DAS system to indicate */

/*     to store these values.  However, since time values require special */

/*                    The size value defaults to 1 if omitted. */

/*                    The DATATYPE keyword defines the data type of */
/*                    column entries.  The DATATYPE assignment syntax */
/*                    has any of the forms */

/*                    Optionally, scalar-valued columns may be indexed. */
/*                    To create an index for a column, use the assignment */

/*                    By default, columns are not indexed. */

/*                    Optionally, any column can allow null values.  To */

/*                    the assigment */

/*                       NULLS_OK = TRUE */

/* $ Files */

/*     See the EK Required Reading for a discussion of the EK file */
/*     format. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     This routine prepares an EK for the creation of a new segment via */
/*     the fast column writer routines.  After this routine is called, */
/*     the columns of the segment are filled in by calls to the fast */
/*     column writer routines of the appropriate data types.  The fast */
/*     column writer routines are: */

/*        EKACLC {EK, add column, character} */
/*        EKACLD {EK, add column, double precision} */
/*        EKACLI {EK, add column, integer} */

/*     When all of the columns have been added, the write operation is */
/*     completed by a call to EKFFLD {EK, finish fast write}. */

/*     The segment is not valid until EKFFLD has been called. */

/*     The EK system supports only one fast write at a time.  It is */
/*     not possible use the fast write routines to simultaneously write */
/*     multiple segments, either in the same EK file or in different */
/*     files. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     1)  Suppose we have an E-kernel named ORDER_DB.EK which contains */
/*         records of orders for data products.  The E-kernel has a */
/*         table called DATAORDERS that consists of the set of columns */
/*         listed below: */

/*            DATAORDERS */

/*               Column Name     Data Type */
/*               -----------     --------- */
/*               ORDER_ID        INTEGER */
/*               CUSTOMER_ID     INTEGER */
/*               LAST_NAME       CHARACTER*(*) */
/*               FIRST_NAME      CHARACTER*(*) */
/*               ORDER_DATE      TIME */
/*               COST            DOUBLE PRECISION */

/*         The order database also has a table of items that have been */
/*         ordered.  The columns of this table are shown below: */

/*            DATAITEMS */

/*               Column Name     Data Type */
/*               -----------     --------- */
/*               ITEM_ID         INTEGER */
/*               ORDER_ID        INTEGER */
/*               ITEM_NAME       CHARACTER*(*) */
/*               DESCRIPTION     CHARACTER*(*) */
/*               PRICE           DOUBLE PRECISION */


/*         We'll suppose that the file ORDER_DB.EK contains two segments, */
/*         the first containing the DATAORDERS table and the second */
/*         containing the DATAITEMS table. */

/*         Below, we show how we'd open a new EK file and create the */
/*         first of the segments described above. */

/*            C     reserve any space for the comment area, so the */
/*            C     number of reserved comment characters is zero. */
/*            C     The variable IFNAME is the internal file name. */
/*            C */

/*                  CALL EKOPN ( 'ORDER_DB.EK', IFNAME, NRESVC, HANDLE ) */

/*            C */
/*            C     Set up the table and column names and declarations */
/*            C     for the DATAORDERS segment.  We'll index all of */
/*            C     the columns.  All columns are scalar, so we omit */
/*            C     the size declaration.  Only the COST column may take */
/*            C     null values. */
/*            C */
