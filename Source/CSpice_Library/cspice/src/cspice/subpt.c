/* $ Detailed_Input */

/*     METHOD      is a short string specifying the computation method */
/*                 to be used.  The choices are: */

/*                    'Near point'       The sub-observer point is */
/*                                       defined as the nearest point on */
/*                                       the target relative to the */
/*                                       observer. */

/*                    'Intercept'        The sub-observer point is */
/*                                       defined as the target surface */
/*                                       intercept of the line */
/*                                       containing the observer and the */
/*                                       target's center. */

/*                 In both cases, the intercept computation treats the */
/*                 surface of the target body as a triaxial ellipsoid. */
/*                 The ellipsoid's radii must be available in the kernel */
/*                 pool. */

/*                 Neither case nor white space are significant in */
/*                 METHOD.  For example, the string ' NEARPOINT' is */
/*                 valid. */


/*     TARGET      is the name of a target body.  Optionally, you may */
/*                 supply the integer ID code for the object as */
/*                 an integer string.  For example both 'MOON' and */
/*                 '301' are legitimate strings that indicate the */
/*                 moon is the target body. This routine assumes */
/*                 that this body is modeled by a tri-axial ellipsoid, */
/*                 and that a PCK file containing its radii has been */
/*                 loaded into the kernel pool via FURNSH. */

/*     ET          is the epoch in ephemeris seconds past J2000 at which */
/*                 the sub-observer point on the target body is to be */
/*                 computed. */


/*     ABCORR      indicates the aberration corrections to be applied */
/*                 when computing the observer-target state.  ABCORR */
/*                 may be any of the following. */

/*                    'NONE'     Apply no correction. Return the */
/*                               geometric sub-observer point on the */
/*                               target body. */

/*                    'LT'       Correct for planetary (light time) */
/*                               aberration.  Both the state and rotation */
/*                               of the target body are corrected for */
/*                               light time. */

/*                    'LT+S'     Correct for planetary (light time) and */

/*                               rotation of the target body are */
/*                               corrected for light time. */


/*                    'CN'       Converged Newtonian light time */
/*                               correction. In solving the light time */
/*                               equation, the 'CN' correction iterates */
/*                               until the solution converges (three */
/*                               iterations on all supported platforms). */
/*                               Whether the 'CN+S' solution is */
/*                               substantially more accurate than the */
/*                               'LT' solution depends on the geometry */
/*                               of the participating objects and on the */
/*                               accuracy of the input data. In all */
/*                               cases this routine will execute more */
/*                               slowly when a converged solution is */
/*                               computed. See the Particulars section */

/*                               of light time corrections. */

/*                               Both the state and rotation of the */

/*                               Both the state and rotation of the */

/*                               time. */

/*     OBSRVR      is the name of the observing body.  This is typically */
/*                 a spacecraft, the earth, or a surface point on the */
/*                 earth. Optionally, you  may supply the ID code of */
/*                 the object as an integer string. For example, both */
/*                 'EARTH' and '399' are legitimate strings to supply */
/*                 to indicate the observer is Earth. */

/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*     SPOINT      is the sub-observer point on the target body at ET */
/*                 expressed relative to the body-fixed frame of the */
/*                 target body. */

/*                 The sub-observer point is defined either as the point */
/*                 on the target body that is closest to the observer, */
/*                 or the target surface intercept of the line from the */
/*                 observer to the target's center; the input argument */
/*                 METHOD selects the definition to be used. */

/*                 The body-fixed frame, which is time-dependent, is */
/*                 evaluated at ET if ABCORR is 'NONE'; otherwise the */
/*                 frame is evaluated at ET-LT, where LT is the one-way */
/*                 light time from target to observer. */

/*                 The state of the target body is corrected for */
/*                 aberration as specified by ABCORR; the corrected */
/*                 state is used in the geometric computation.  As */
/*                 indicated above, the rotation of the target is */
/*                 retarded by one-way light time if ABCORR specifies */
/*                 that light time correction is to be done. */


/*     ALT         is the "altitude" of the observer above the target */
/*                 body.  When METHOD specifies a "near point" */
/*                 computation, ALT is truly altitude in the standard */
/*                 geometric sense:  the length of a segment dropped from */
/*                 the observer to the target's surface, such that the */
/*                 segment is perpendicular to the surface at the */
/*                 contact point SPOINT. */

/*                 When METHOD specifies an "intercept" computation, ALT */
/*                 is still the length of the segment from the observer */
/*                 to the surface point SPOINT, but this segment in */
/*                 general is not perpendicular to the surface. */

/* $ Parameters */

/*     None. */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*     If any of the listed errors occur, the output arguments are */
/*     left unchanged. */


/*     1) If the input argument METHOD is not recognized, the error */
/*        SPICE(DUBIOUSMETHOD) is signaled. */

/*     2) If either of the input body names TARGET or OBSRVR cannot be */
/*        mapped to NAIF integer codes, the error SPICE(IDCODENOTFOUND) */
/*        is signaled. */

/*     3) If OBSRVR and TARGET map to the same NAIF integer ID codes, the */
/*        error SPICE(BODIESNOTDISTINCT) is signaled. */

/*     4) If frame definition data enabling the evaluation of the state */
/*        of the target relative to the observer in target body-fixed */
/*        coordinates have not been loaded prior to calling SUBPT, the */
/*        error will be diagnosed and signaled by a routine in the call */
/*        tree of this routine. */

/*     5) If the specified aberration correction is not recognized, the */
/*        error will be diagnosed and signaled by a routine in the call */
/*        tree of this routine. */

/*     6) If insufficient ephemeris data have been loaded prior to */
/*        calling SUBPT, the error will be diagnosed and signaled by a */
/*        routine in the call tree of this routine. */

/*     7) If the triaxial radii of the target body have not been loaded */
/*        into the kernel pool prior to calling SUBPT, the error will be */
/*        diagnosed and signaled by a routine in the call tree of this */
/*        routine. */

/*     8) The target must be an extended body:  if any of the radii of */
/*        the target body are non-positive, the error will be diagnosed */
/*        and signaled by routines in the call tree of this routine. */

/*     9) If PCK data supplying a rotation model for the target body */
/*        have not been loaded prior to calling SUBPT, the error will be */
/*        diagnosed and signaled by a routine in the call tree of this */
/*        routine. */

/* $ Files */

/*     Appropriate SPK, PCK, and frame kernels must be loaded */
/*     prior by the calling program before this routine is called. */

/*     The following data are required: */

/*        - SPK data:  ephemeris data for target and observer must be */
/*          loaded.  If aberration corrections are used, the states of */
/*          target and observer relative to the solar system barycenter */
/*          must be calculable from the available ephemeris data. */
/*          Typically ephemeris data are made available by loading one */
/*          or more SPK files via FURNSH. */

/*        - PCK data:  triaxial radii for the target body must be loaded */
/*          into the kernel pool.  Typically this is done by loading a */
/*          text PCK file via FURNSH. */

/*        - Further PCK data:  rotation data for the target body must */
/*          be loaded.  These may be provided in a text or binary PCK */
/*          file.  Either type of file may be loaded via FURNSH. */

/*        - Frame data:  if a frame definition is required to convert */
/*          the observer and target states to the body-fixed frame of */
/*          the target, that definition must be available in the kernel */
/*          pool.  Typically the definition is supplied by loading a */
/*          frame kernel via FURNSH. */

/*     In all cases, kernel data are normally loaded once per program */
/*     run, NOT every time this routine is called. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     SUBPT computes the sub-observer point on a target body. */
/*     (The sub-observer point is commonly called the sub-spacecraft */
/*     point when the observer is a spacecraft.)  SUBPT also */
/*     determines the altitude of the observer above the target body. */

/*     There are two different popular ways to define the sub-observer */
/*     point:  "nearest point on target to observer" or "target surface */
/*     intercept of line containing observer and target."  These */
/*     coincide when the target is spherical and generally are distinct */
/*     otherwise. */

/*     When comparing sub-point computations with results from sources */
/*     other than SPICE, it's essential to make sure the same geometric */
/*     definitions are used. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     The numerical results shown for this example may differ across */
/*     platforms.  The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as */
/*     input, the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine */
/*     specific arithmetic implementation. */

/*     In the following example program, the file */

/*        spk_m_031103-040201_030502.bsp */

/*     is a binary SPK file containing data for Mars Global Surveyor, */
/*     Mars, and the Sun for a time interval bracketing the date */

/*         2004 JAN 1 12:00:00 UTC. */

/*     pck00007.tpc is a planetary constants kernel file containing */
/*     radii and rotation model constants.  naif0007.tls is a */
/*     leapseconds kernel. */

/*     Find the sub-observer point of the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) */
/*     spacecraft on Mars for a specified time.  Perform the computation */
/*     twice, using both the "intercept" and "near point" options. */
