/*     DEVICE     I   A string specifying an output device. */
/*     LINE       I   A line of text to be output. */
/*     FILEN      P   Maximum length of a file name. */

/* $ Detailed_Input */

/*     LINE           is a line of text to be written to the output */
/*                    device specified by DEVICE. */

/*     DEVICE         is the output device to which the line of text */
/*                    will be written. */

/*                    Possible values and meanings of DEVICE are: */

/*                       a device name   This may be the name of a */
/*                                       file, or any other name that */
/*                                       is valid in a FORTRAN OPEN */
/*                                       statement.  For example, on a */
/*                                       VAX, a logical name may be */
/*                                       used. */

/*                                       The device name must not */
/*                                       be any of the reserved strings */
/*                                       below. */


/*                       'SCREEN'        The output will go to the */
/*                                       terminal screen. */


/*                       'NULL'          The data will not be output. */


/*                 'SCREEN' and 'NULL' can be written in mixed */
/*                  case.  For example, the following call will work: */

/*                  CALL WRLINE ( 'screEn', LINE ) */

/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*     None. */

/* $ Parameters */

/*     FILEN        is the maximum length of a file name. */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*     This routine is a special case as far as error handling */
/*     is concerned because it is called to output error */
/*     messages resulting from errors detected by other routines. */
/*     In such a case, calling SIGERR would constitute recursion. */
/*     Therefore, this routine prints error messages rather */
/*     than signalling errors via SIGERR and setting the long */
/*     error message via SETMSG. */

/*     The following exceptional cases are treated as errors: */

/*     1)  SPICE(NOFREELOGICALUNIT) -- No logical unit number */
/*         is available to refer to the device. */

/*     2)  SPICE(FILEOPENFAILED) -- General file open error. */

/*     3)  SPICE(FILEWRITEFAILED) -- General file write error. */

/*     4)  SPICE(INQUIREFAILED) -- INQUIRE statement failed. */

/*     5)  Leading blanks in (non-blank) file names are not */
/*         significant.  The file names */

/*             'MYFILE.DAT' */
/*             '   MYFILE.DAT' */

/*         are considered to name the same file. */

/*     6)  If different names that indicate the same file are supplied */
/*         to this routine on different calls, all output associated */
/*         with these calls WILL be written to the file.  For example, */
/*         on a system where logical filenames are supported, if */
/*         ALIAS is a logical name pointing to MYFILE, then the calls */

/*             CALL WRLINE ( 'MYFILE', 'This is the first line'  ) */
/*             CALL WRLINE ( 'ALIAS',  'This is the second line' ) */

/*         will place the lines of text */

/*              'This is the first line' */
/*              'This is the second line' */

/*         in MYFILE.  See $Restrictions for more information on use */
/*         of logical names on VAX systems. */

/* $ Files */

/*     1)  If DEVICE specifies a device other than 'SCREEN' or 'NULL', */
/*         that device is opened (if it's not already open) as a NEW, */
/*         SEQUENTIAL, FORMATTED file.  The logical unit used is */
/*         determined at run time. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     If the output device is a file that is not open, the file will */
/*     be opened (if possible) as a NEW, sequential, formatted file, */
/*     and the line of text will be written to the file.  If the file */
/*     is already opened as a sequential, formatted file, the line of */
/*     text will be written to the file. */

/*     Use the entry point CLLINE to close files opened by WRLINE. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     1)  Write a message to the screen: */

/*                CALL WRLINE ( 'SCREEN', 'Here''s a message.' ) */

/*         The text */

/*                Here's a message. */

/*         will be written to the screen. */


/*     2)  Write out all of the elements of a character string array */
/*         to a file. */

/*                CHARACTER*(80)          STRING ( ASIZE ) */
/*                             . */
/*                             . */
/*                             . */
/*                DO I = 1, ASIZE */
/*                   CALL WRLINE ( FILE, STRING(I) ) */
/*                END DO */


/*     3)  Set DEVICE to NULL to suppress output: */

/*             C */
/*             C     Ask the user whether verbose program output is */
/*             C     desired.  Set the output device accordingly. */
/*             C */
/*                   WRITE (*,*) 'Do you want to see test results '    // */
/*                  .            'on the screen?' */
/*                   READ  (*,FMT='(A)') VERBOS */

/*                   CALL LJUST ( VERBOS, VERBOS ) */
/*                   CALL UCASE ( VERBOS, VERBOS ) */

/*                   IF ( VERBOS(1:1) .EQ. 'Y' ) THEN */
/*                      DEVICE = 'SCREEN' */
/*                   ELSE */
/*                      DEVICE = 'NULL' */
/*                   ENDIF */
/*                             . */
/*                             . */
/*                             . */
/*             C */
/*             C     Output test results. */
/*             C */
/*                   CALL WRLINE ( DEVICE, STRING ) */
/*                             . */
/*                             . */
/*                             . */

/* $ Restrictions */

/*     1)  File names must not exceed FILEN characters. */

/*     2)  On VAX systems, caution should be exercised when using */
/*         multiple logical names to point to the same file.  Logical */
/*         name translation supporting execution of the Fortran */
/*         INQUIRE statement does not appear to work reliably in all */
/*         cases, which may lead this routine to believe that different */
/*         logical names indicate different files.  The specific problem */
/*         that has been observed is that logical names that include */
/*         disk specifications are not always recognized as pointing */
/*         to the file they actually name. */

/*            The header has been updated accordingly. */

/*            This fix also fixes a bug wherein this routine would treat */
/*            different character strings naming the same file as though */
/*            they indicated different files. */

/*        2)  The limit imposed by this routine on the number of files it */
/*            can open has been removed.  The file database used in */
/*            previous versions of this routine is no longer used. */

/*        3)  On VAX systems, this routine now opens the output file */
/*            (when required to do so) as a normal text file. */

/*        4)  Improper treatment of the case where DEVICE is blank was */
/*            remedied.  Any value of DEVICE that is not equal to */
/*            'SCREEN' or 'NULL' after being left-justified and */
/*            converted to upper case is considered to be a file name. */

/*        5)  Unneeded variable declarations and references were removed. */
/*            The arrays called STATUS and FILES are not needed. */

/*        6)  All instances if "PRINT *" have been replaced by */
/*            "WRITE (*,*)" because Language Systems Fortran on the */
/*            Macintosh interprets "PRINT *" in a non-standard manner. */

/*        7)  Use of the EXIST specifier was added to the INQUIRE */
/*            statement used to determine whether the file named by */
/*            DEVICE is open.  This is a work-around for a rather */
/*            peculiar behavior of at least one version of Sun Fortran: */
/*            files that don't exist may be considered to be open, as */
/*            indicated by the OPENED specifier of the INQUIRE statement. */

/*        8)  One other thing:  now that LJUST and UCASE are error-free, */
/*            WRLINE uses them; this simplifies the code. */


/* -    Beta Version 1.2.0, 27-FEB-1989 (NJB) */

/*        Call to GETLUN replaced by call to FNDLUN, which is error-free. */
/*        Call to IOERR replaced with in-line code to construct long */
/*        error message indicating file open failure. Arrangement of */
/*        declarations changed.  Keywords added. FILEN declaration */
/*        moved to "declarations" section.  Parameters section added. */

/* -    Beta Version 1.1.0, 06-OCT-1988 (NJB) */

/*        Upper bound of written substring changed to prevent use of */
/*        invalid substring bound.  Specifically, LASTNB ( LINE ) was */
/*        replaced by  MAX ( 1, LASTNB (LINE) ).  This upper bound */
/*        now used in the PRINT statement as well. */
