/*     ARRAY      I    Input array. */
/*     NDIM       I    Dimension of ARRAY. */
/*     IORDER     O    Order vector for ARRAY. */

/* $ Detailed_Input */

/*     ARRAY       is the input array. */

/*     NDIM        is the number of elements in the input array. */

/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*     IORDER      is the order vector for the input array. */
/*                 IORDER(1) is the index of the smallest element */
/*                 of ARRAY; IORDER(2) is the index of the next */
/*                 smallest; and so on. */

/* $ Parameters */

/*     None. */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*     1) A negative input dimension causes this routine to */
/*        leave the output order vector unchanged. */

/*     This routine is error free. */

/* $ Files */

/*     None. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     ORDERD finds the index of the smallest element of the input */
/*     array. This becomes the first element of the order vector. */
/*     The process is repeated for the rest of the elements. */

/*     The order vector returned by ORDERD may be used by any of */
/*     the REORD routines to sort sets of related arrays, as shown */
/*     in the example below. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     In the following example, the ORDER and REORD routines are */
/*     used to sort four related arrays (containing the names, */
/*     masses, integer ID codes, and visual magnitudes for a group */
/*     of satellites). This is representative of the typical use of */
/*     these routines. */

/*            C */
/*            C     Sort the object arrays by visual magnitude. */
