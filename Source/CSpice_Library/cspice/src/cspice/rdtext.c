/*     MAXOPN     P   Maximum number of open files. */
/*     MAXLEN     P   Maximum file name length. */

/* $ Detailed_Input */

/*     FILE        is the name of the text file from which the next */
/*                 line is to be read. If the file is not currently */
/*                 open, it is opened with a logical unit determined */
/*                 at run time, and the first line of the file is */
/*                 returned. Otherwise, the next line not yet read */
/*                 from the file is read and returned. */

/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*     LINE        is next line of text in the specified file. */
/*                 If the end of the file is reached, LINE is blank. */

/*     EOF         is true when the end of the file is reached, and is */
/*                 otherwise false. */

/* $ Parameters */

/*     MAXOPN      is the maximum number of files that can be kept */
/*                 open simultaneously by RDTEXT. */

/*                 VAX: */

/*                  The default number of files that can be open at one */
/*                  time during a user's process is determined by the */
/*                  value of FILLM. This number is usually 20, but it */
/*                  may be changed by a user with sufficient privileges. */

/*                 IBM PC / Microsoft FORTRAN 5.0: */

/*                  The default value for the maximum number of files */
/*                  open at one time is 20. This value may be changed */
/*                  by modifying the appropriate startup files as */
/*                  specified in the reference documentation. */

/*                 IBM PC / Linux / Fort77: */

/*                  An experiment showed that a program can */
/*                  simultaneiously open one file for each available */
/*                  logical unit; this amounts to 96 files. */

/*                 Sun / Sun FORTRAN: */

/*                  "The maximum number of logical units that a program */
/*                  can have open at one time is the same as the SunOS */
/*                  system limit, currently 64." */

/*                 HP-UX 9000/750, FORTRAN/9000 Series 700 computers and */
/*                 Silicon Graphics: */

/*                  NAIF used a program to determine this value. Also, */
/*                  the values can be found by executing the command */
/*                  "man limits" and reading the value for OPEN_MAX. */
/*                  This value is listed as 60, but two units are used */
/*                  for standard output and standard error. */

/*                 DEC Alpha-OSF/1: */

/*                  The comment in the output from the command */
/*                  "man limits" stated that the value of OPEN_MAX was */
/*                  64, but that it was "OBSOLETE, sysconf() interface */
/*                  should be used". Looking into sysconf did not produce */
/*                  any numbers, so the value is set at 20 because it */
/*                  works! */

/*                 NeXT/Absoft Fortran: */

/*                  We couldn't find any documentation that addressed */
/*                  this value, so we set it to 20. */


/*     MAXLEN      is the maximum length of the file names that may */
/*                 used to identify the files opened by RDTEXT. */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*     1) If too many files are open already, the error */
/*        SPICE(TOOMANYFILESOPEN) is signalled. */

/*     2) If the attempt to open the file fails, the error */
/*        SPICE(FILEOPENFAILED) is signalled. */

/*     3) If the attempt to read from the file fails, the error */
/*        SPICE(FILEREADFAILED) is signalled. */

/*     4) If the attempt to "inquire" the status of the file fails, */
/*        the error SPICE(INQUIREFAILED) is signalled. */

/* $ Files */

/*     See input FILE. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     RDTEXT reads the next line from a text file. If the file is */
/*     not currently open, it is opened with a logical unit determined */
/*     at run time, and the first line of the file is returned. */
/*     Otherwise, the next line not yet read from the file is returned. */

/*     If the end of the file is reached, a blank line is returned, */
/*     the end-of-file indicator is true, and the file is closed. */

/*     Several files may be opened and read simultaneously. Thus, */
/*     you may begin reading from one file before the end of another */
/*     file has been reached. RDTEXT maintains a separate file pointer */
/*     for each file. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     Let FILE.1 contain the following lines. */

/*        Mary had a little lamb */
/*        Everywhere that Mary went */

/*     Let FILE.2 contain the following lines. */

/*        Its fleece was white as snow. */
/*        The lamb was sure to go. */

/*     Then the code fragment */

/*        DO I = 1, 2 */
/*           CALL RDTEXT ( 'FILE.1', LINE, EOF ) */
/*           WRITE (6,*) LINE */

/*           CALL RDTEXT ( 'FILE.2', LINE, EOF ) */
/*           WRITE (6,*) LINE */
/*        END DO */

/*     produces the following output */

/*        Mary had a little lamb */
/*        Its fleece was white as snow. */
/*        Everywhere that Mary went */
/*        The lamb was sure to go. */

/* $ Restrictions */

/*     1) The values of MAXOPN and MAXLEN should not exceed any */
/*        corresponding limits imposed by the operating system. */

/*     2) If the input file is a print file, the carriage control */
/*        character at the beginning of a given line will be considered */
/*        part of the line. (Text files have no carriage control */
/*        characters.) */

/*     3) In order to avoid access violations, the VAX/VMS version of */
/*        RDTEXT uses the VAX READONLY qualifier to open files. This */
/*        must be removed or replaced when the routine is ported to */
/*        non-VAX/VMS systems. */

/*     4)  On VAX systems, caution should be exercised when using */
/*         multiple logical names to point to the same file.  Logical */
/*         name translation supporting execution of the Fortran */
/*         INQUIRE statement does not appear to work reliably in all */
/*         cases, which may lead this routine to believe that different */
/*         logical names indicate different files.  The specific problem */
/*         that has been observed is that logical names that include */
/*         disk specifications are not always recognized as pointing */
/*         to the file they actually name. */

/*       The variable N, representing the number of files currently */

/*       The method of checking whether the file to be read is one */
/*       already opened for reading by this routine has been improved. */
/*       Formerly, the input file name was compared against a list of */
/*       names of routines already opened by RDTEXT.  If the input name */
/*       pointed to a file that had been opened using a different name, */
/*       RDTEXT would not recognize that the new name pointed to a file */
/*       that was already open.  The technique used now greatly reduces */
/*       the chance of such an error.  The input file name is compared */
/*       to the previous input file name, and if the names do not agree, */
/*       an INQUIRE is performed to test whether the file named by the */
/*       input file name is already open.  Only if this INQUIRE */

/*     --------  ---  -------------------------------------------------- */
/*     FILE       I   Text file to be closed. */

/* $ Detailed_Input */

/*     FILE        is the name of a text file which is currently */
/*                 opened for reading or writing by RDTEXT. */

/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*     None. */

/* $ Parameters */

/*     None. */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*     1) If the attempt to "inquire" the status of the file fails, */
/*        the error SPICE(INQUIREFAILED) is signalled. */

/* $ Files */

/*     The text file, FILE, was previously opened by RDTEXT. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     CLTEXT closes one of the files currently opened for reading or */
/*     writing by RDTEXT. If the specified file is not open, nothing */
/*     happens. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     None. */

/* $ Restrictions */

/*     1)  On VAX systems, caution should be exercised when using */
/*         multiple logical names to point to the same file.  Logical */
/*         name translation supporting execution of the Fortran */
/*         INQUIRE statement does not appear to work reliably in all */
/*         cases, which may lead this routine to believe that different */
/*         logical names indicate different files.  The specific problem */
/*         that has been observed is that logical names that include */
/*         disk specifications are not always recognized as pointing */
/*         to the file they actually name. */

/* $ Literature_References */

/*     None. */

/*        The environment lines were expanded so that the supported */
/*        environments are now explicitly given.  Previously, */
/*        environments such as SUN-SUNOS and SUN-SOLARIS were implied */
/*        by the environment label SUN. */

/* -    SPICELIB Version 3.0.0, 27-SEP-1994 (WLT) */

/*        The check of RETURN was removed so that routines that need */
/*        to close a text file can do so even if an error has been */
/*        detected somewhere else in a user's program. */

/* -    SPICELIB Version 2.0.1, 10-MAR-1992 (WLT) */

/*        Comment section for permuted index source lines was added */

/*        Method of recognizing whether input file name points to */
/*        a file opened by RDTEXT has been improved.  Formerly, CLTEXT */
/*        compared the input file name to a list of names of files */
/*        opened by RDTEXT.  If the input name pointed to a file that */
/*        had been opened using a different name, CLTEXT would not */
/*        recognize that the new name pointed to a file that was already */
/*        open.  The technique used now greatly reduces the chance of */
/*        such an error.  Now, and INQUIRE is performed to obtain the */
/*        unit number attached to the file named by the input file name. */
/*        If this unit is attached to a file opened by RDTEXT, CLTEXT */
/*        will close that file. */
