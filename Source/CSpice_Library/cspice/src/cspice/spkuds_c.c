-Detailed_Input
 
   descr      is an SPK segment descriptor. 
 
-Detailed_Output
 
   body       is the NAIF ID code for the body of the segment. 
 
   center     is the center of motion for body. 
 
   frame      is the SPICE integer code for the frame to which states 
              for the body are be referenced. 
 
   type       is the type of SPK segment. 
 
   first      is the first epoch for which the segment has 
              ephemeris data. 
 
   last       is the last epoch for which the segment has 
              ephemeris data. 
 
   begin      is the starting address of the data associated 
              with this descriptor. 
 
   end        is the last address of the data associated with 
              this descriptor. 
 
-Parameters
 
   None. 
 
-Particulars
 
   This routine extracts the contents of an SPK segment 
   descriptor into the components needed for reading and 
   evaluating the data stored in the segment.  It serves 
   as a macro for expanding the SPK segment descriptor. 
 
-Examples
 
   Suppose you wished to summarize a particular SPK segment 
   and that you have the descriptor for that segment in hand. 
   The following code fragment shows how you might use this 
   routine to create a summary message concerning the segment. 
 
      #include <stdio.h>
      #include "SpiceUsr.h"
      
      #define   TIMLEN       35
            .
            .

      spkuds_c ( descr,  &body, &center, &frame, 
  .              &type,  &first, &last,  &baddr, &eaddr ); 
 
      /.
      Convert the start and stop times to TDB calendar strings.
      ./
      etcal_c ( first, TIMLEN, fstcal ); 
      etcal_c ( last,  TIMLEN, lstcal ); 
 
      printf ( "\n"
               "Body     : %d\n"  
               "Center   : %d\n"   
               "Frame ID : %d\n"   
               "Data Type: %d\n"  
               "\n"
               "Segment Start :  %s\n"  
               "Segment Stop  :  %s\n",
               body,
               center,
               frame,
               type,
               fstcal,
               lstcal                   );

-Version
 
   -CSPICE Version 1.1.0, 24-JUL-2001   (NJB)

       Changed protoype:  input descr is now type (ConstSpiceDouble *).
       Implemented interface macro for casting input descr to const.
