/*     RECORD     O   The desired type 14 SPK record. */

/* $ Detailed_Input */

/*     HANDLE   is the handle of the open SPK file which contains the */
/*              segment of interest. */

/*     DESCR    is the descriptor for a type 14 SPK segment that contains */
/*              the record of interest. */

/*     ET       is the target epoch used to determine the particular */
/*              record to be obtained from the SPK segment. */

/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*     RECORD   is the record from the specified segment which, */
/*              when evaluated at epoch ET, will give the state */
/*              (position and velocity) of some body, relative */
/*              to some center, in some inertial reference frame. */

/* $ Parameters */

/*     None. */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*     1) It is assumed that the descriptor and handle supplied are */
/*        for a properly constructed type 14 segment. No checks are */
/*        performed to ensure this. */

/*     2) If the input ET value is not within the range specified */
/*        in the segment descriptor, the error SPICE(TIMEOUTOFBOUNDS) */
/*        is signalled. */

/*     3) All other errors are diagnosed by routines in the call tree */
/*        of this routine. */

/* $ Files */

/*     See argument HANDLE. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     This subroutine will read a single record from a type 14 SPK */
/*     segment. The record read will provide the data necessary to */
/*     compute the state for a some body in some inertial frame at epoch */
/*     ET. */

/*     See the SPK Required Reading file for a description of the */
/*     structure of a type 14 SPK segment. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     The data returned by the SPKRnn routine is in a raw form, taken */
/*     directly from the segment.  As such, it will be not be directly */
/*     useful to a user unless they have a complete understanding of the */
/*     structure of the data type.  Given that understanding, however, */
/*     the SPKRnn routines could be used to "dump" and check segment data */
/*     for a particular epoch, as in the example which follows. */


/*     C */
/*     C     Get a segment applicable to a specified body and epoch. */
/*     C */
/*           CALL SPKSFS ( BODY, ET, HANDLE, DESCR, IDENT, FOUND ) */

/*     C */
/*     C     Look at parts of the descriptor. */
/*     C */
/*           CALL DAFUS ( DESCR, 2, 6, DCD, ICD ) */
/*           CENTER = ICD( 2 ) */
/*           REF    = ICD( 3 ) */
/*           TYPE   = ICD( 4 ) */

/*           IF ( TYPE .EQ. 14 ) THEN */
/*              CALL SPKR14 ( HANDLE, DESCR, ET, RECORD ) */
/*                  . */
/*                  .  Look at the RECORD data. */
/*                  . */
/*           END IF */

/* $ Restrictions */

/*     This subroutine should not be called directly by a casual user. It */
/*     is intended for use by the subroutine SPKPV, and certain tests for */
/*     error conditions are not performed here, as SPKPV will have */
/*     already performed them. */
