   SpiceDouble dpmin_c () 

/*

-Brief_I/O
 
   The function returns the value of the smallest (negative) number 
   that can be represented in a double precision variable. 
 
-Detailed_Input
 
   None. 
 
-Detailed_Output
 
   The function returns the value of the smallest (negative) number 
   that can be represented in a double precision variable. 
 
   This value varies from machine to machine.  Usually, the value is 
   defined as the negative of the macro DBL_MAX from the ANSI standard
   header file float.h.  According to the ANSI standard, DBL_MAX must be 
   at least
   
      1.E+37 
      
   Therefore dpmin_c usually returns a value less than or equal to 

     -1.E+37
        
   Exceptional systems would be those where DBL_MAX cannot be negated.
   Currently no such systems are supported.      
 
-Parameters
 
   None. 
 
-Exceptions
 
   Error free. 
 
-Files
 
   None. 
 
-Particulars
 
   The function always returns a constant value, set by the user 
   prior to compilation. 
 
-Examples
 
   The following code fragments illustrate the use of dpmin_c. 
   Note in the example that the smallest negative number is not assumed
   to be the negative of the largest positive number. 
 
   1) Initialize a CSPICE "window."
   
      /.
      The window originally has one interval, from "minus 
      infinity" to "plus infinity". 
      ./
      
      winsiz    =  2;
      window[0] =  dpmin_c();
      window[1] =  dpmax_c() ;

      scardd_ ( &winsiz, window );
