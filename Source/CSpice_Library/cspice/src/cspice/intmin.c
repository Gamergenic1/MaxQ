   SpiceInt intmin_ () 

/*

-Brief_I/O
 
   The function returns the value of the smallest (negative) number 
   that can be represented in a variable of type "integer." 
 
-Detailed_Input
 
   None. 
 
-Detailed_Output
 
   The function returns the value of the smallest negative number 
   (negative number of largest magnitude) that can be represented in an 
   "integer" variable, where integer is a typedef defined in f2c.h.  The 
   typedef SpiceInt always maps to the same type as does the f2c typedef 
   integer.
 
   The returned value will be less than or equal to -2147483647.
   See the Particulars section for details.
      
-Parameters
 
   None. 
 
-Exceptions
 
   Error free. 
 
-Files
 
   None. 
 
-Particulars
 
   This function replaces that produced by running f2c on the Fortran
   SPICELIB file intmin.f. 
 
   When translating Fortran code, f2c maps Fortran variables of type
   INTEGER to C variables of type "integer," where integer is a typedef
   defined in the f2c header file f2c.h.  On all supported platforms, 
   Fortran INTEGERS occupy at least 32 bits.  On most platforms, this 
   means that the typedef integer translates to type long.  There are 
   some exceptional platforms on which an integer translates to type 
   int.  The mapping must provide compatibility with the f2c typedef
   doublereal:  integers must occupy half the storage of doublereals in 
   order for these types to correctly represent the Fortran types 
   INTEGER and DOUBLE PRECISION.
   
   On systems where the typedef integer maps to type long, the return
   value is defined by the macro LONG_MIN from the ANSI standard header
   file limits.h. According to the ANSI standard, LONG_MIN must be no 
   greater than
   
      -2147483647 
    
   This is 
   
           31
      - ( 2   - 1 )
      
   On systems where the typedef integer maps to type int, the value is
   defined by the macro INT_MIN from the ANSI standard header file 
   limits.h. According to the ANSI standard, INT_MIN must be no greater
   than
      
      -32767
    
   This is 
   
          15
      -( 2   - 1 )
            
   In practice however, the typedef integer will map to type int only
   if ints occupy at least four bytes, so the value of INT_MIN will
   actually be no greater than -2147483647.
   
   
-Examples
 
   The following code fragment illustrates the use of intmin_. 
 
      /.
      Separate a double into integer and fractional components.
      If the integer component is out of range, avoid overflow 
      by making it as large as possible. 
      ./
      #include <math.h>
               .
               .
               .
      fract = modf ( dvalue, &integralDP ); 
      
      if (  integralDP  >  (double)intmax_()  ) 
      { 
         ivalue = intmax_();
      }
      else if (  integralDP  <  (double)intmin_()  )   
      {
         ivalue = intmin_(); 
      }
      else 
      {
         ivalue = (long)( integralDP );
      }
