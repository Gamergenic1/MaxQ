/*      INSTR      I   Input string. */
/*      OLD        I   Character to be replaced. */
/*      NEW        I   Replacement character. */
/*      OUTSTR     O   Output string. */

/* $ Detailed_Input */

/*      INSTR       is the input character string, possibly containing */
/*                  one or more occurrences of the character OLD. */

/*      OLD         is the character to be replaced wherever it occurs in */
/*                  the input string. */

/*      NEW         is the character which is to replace each occurrence */
/*                  of the character OLD in the output string. */

/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*      OUTSTR      is the output string. This is the input string */
/*                  with every occurrence of the character OLD replaced */
/*                  by the character NEW. */

/*                  OUTSTR may overwrite INSTR. */

/* $ Parameters */

/*     None. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*      Copy the contents of the input string to the output string */
/*      a character at a time, replacing each occurrence of OLD with NEW. */
/*      If the output string is not long enough to contain the input */
/*      string, it is truncated on the right. */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*      Error free. */

/* $ Files */

/*      None. */

/* $ Examples */

/*      Let */
/*            INSTR  = 'Woodsy is the Anti-Pollution Owl.' */
/*            OLD    = 'O' */
/*            NEW    = 'E' */
/*      then */
/*            OUTSTR = 'Woodsy is the Anti-Pollution Ewl.' */

/*      Note the case-sensitivity of REPLCH. The lowercase o's are */
/*      not affected. */

/*      REPLCH may similarly be used to replace control characters */
/*      (such as tab stops, line feeds, and nulls) with regular ASCII */
/*      characters (such as blanks). */

/* $ Restrictions */

/*      REPLCH is sensitive to case, as shown in the examples above. */
