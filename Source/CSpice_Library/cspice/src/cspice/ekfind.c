/*     Include Section:  EK Encoded Query Internal Parameters */

/*        ekquery.inc  Version 3    16-NOV-1995 (NJB) */

/*           Updated to reflect increased value of MAXCON in */
/*           ekqlimit.inc. */

/*        ekquery.inc  Version 2    03-AUG-1995 (NJB) */

/*           Updated to support representation of the SELECT clause. */


/*        ekquery.inc  Version 1    12-JAN-1995 (NJB) */


/*     An encoded EK query is an abstract data type implemented */
/*     as an integer cell, along with a double precision cell and */
/*     a character string.  The d.p. cell and string contain numeric */
/*     and string values from the query string represented by the */
/*     encoded query. */

/*     The parameters in this file are intended for use only by the */
/*     EK encoded query access routines.  Callers of EK routines should */
/*     not use these parameters. */

/*     The following parameters are indices of specified elements */
/*     in the integer portion of the encoded query. */

/*     Encoded query architecture type: */


/*     `Name resolution' consists of: */

/*        - Verifying existence of tables:  any table names listed */
/*          in the FROM clause of a query must be loaded. */

/*        - Validating table aliases used to qualify column names. */

/*        - Verifying existence of columns and obtaining data types */
/*          for columns. */

/*        - Setting data type codes for literal values in the encoded */
/*          query. */

/*        - Checking consistency of operators and operand data types. */

/*        - Making sure unqualified column names are unambiguous. */

/*        - For constraints, mapping the table names used to qualify */
/*          column names to the ordinal position in the FROM clause */
/*          of the corresponding table. */


/*     Initialization status---this flag indicates whether the encoded */
/*     query has been initialized.  Values are ITRUE or IFALSE.  See the */
/*     include file ekbool.inc for parameter values. */


/*     Parse status---this flag indicates whether the parsing operation */
/*     that produced an encoded query has been completed. Values are */
/*     ITRUE or IFALSE. */


/*     Name resolution status---this flag indicates whether names */
/*     have been resolved in an encoded query.  Values are ITRUE or */
/*     IFALSE. */


/*     Time resolution status---this flag indicates whether time values */
/*     have been resolved in an encoded query.  Time resolution */
/*     consists of converting strings representing time values to ET. */
/*     Values of the status are ITRUE or IFALSE. */


/*     Semantic check status---this flag indicates whether semantic */
/*     checking of constraints has been performed. */


/*     Number of tables specified in FROM clause: */


/*     Number of constraints in query: */


/*     A special value is used to indicate the `maximal' constraint--- */
/*     one that logically cannot be satisfied.  If the constraints */
/*     are equivalent to the maximal constraint, the location EQNCNS */
/*     is assigned the value EQMXML */


/*     Number of constraint conjunctions: */


/*     Number of order-by columns: */


/*     Number of SELECT columns: */


/*     Size of double precision buffer: */


/*     `Free' pointer into double precision buffer: */


/*     Size of character string buffer: */


/*     `Free' pointer into character string buffer: */


/*     The following four base pointers will be valid after a query */
/*     has been parsed: */

/*     Base pointer for SELECT column descriptors: */


/*     Base pointer for constraint descriptors: */


/*     Base pointer for conjunction sizes: */


/*     Base pointer for order-by column descriptors: */


/*     After the quantities named above, the integer array contains */
/*     series of descriptors for tables, constraints, and order-by */
/*     columns, as well as a list of `conjunction sizes'---that is, */
/*     the sizes of the groups of constraints that form conjunctions, */
/*     after the input query has been re-arranged as a disjunction of */
/*     conjunctions of constraints. */


/*     The offsets of specific elements within descriptors are */
/*     parameterized. The base addresses of the descriptors themselves */
/*     must be  calculated using the counts and sizes of the items */
/*     preceding them. */

/*     A diagram of the structure of the variable-size portion of the */
/*     integer array is shown below: */


/*        +-------------------------------------+ */
/*        | Fixed-size portion of encoded query | */
/*        +-------------------------------------+ */
/*        |         Encoded FROM clause         | */

/*        +-------------------------------------+ */
/*        |        Encoded SELECT clause        | */
/*        +-------------------------------------+ */


/*     Value Descriptors */
/*     ---------------- */

/*     In order to discuss the various descriptors below, we'll make use */
/*     of sub-structures called `value descriptors'.  These descriptors */
/*     come in two flavors:  character and double precision.  For */
/*     strings, a descriptor is a set of begin and end pointers that */
/*     indicate the location of the string in the character portion of an */
/*     encoded query, along with the begin and end pointers for the */
/*     corresponding lexeme in the original query.  The pointers are set */
/*     to zero when they are not in use, for example if they refer to an */
/*     optional lexeme that did not appear in the input query. */

/*     All value descriptors start with a data type indicator; values */
/*     are from ektype.inc.  Integer and time values are referred to */
/*     by double precision descriptors. */

/*     Parameters for string value descriptor elements: */


/*     Numeric value descriptors are similar to those for string values, */
/*     the difference being that they have only one pointer to the value */
/*     they represent.  This pointer is the index of the value in the */
/*     encoded query's numeric buffer. */


/*     All value descriptors have the same size.  In order to allow */
/*     table descriptors to have the same size as value descriptors, */
/*     we include an extra element in the descriptor. */


/*     Column Descriptors */
/*     ----------------- */

/*     Each column descriptor consists of a character descriptor for the */
/*     name of the column, followed by an index, which gives the ordinal */
/*     position of the column in the logical table to which the column */
/*     belongs.  The index element is filled in during name resolution. */


/*     Table Descriptors */
/*     ----------------- */

/*     Each table descriptor consists of a character descriptor for the */
/*     name of the table, followed by an index, which gives the ordinal */
/*     position of the table in the FROM clause in the original query. */
/*     The index element is filled in during name resolution.  Aliases */
/*     and table names have identical descriptor structures. */


/*     Constraint descriptors */
/*     ------------------ */

/*     Each constraint is characterized by: */

/*        - A code indicating whether the constraint compares values */
/*          in two columns or the value in a column and a literal */
/*          value.  The values of this element are EQCOL and EQVAL. */



/*        - A descriptor for the table used to qualify the */
/*          column name on the left side of the constraint. */


/*        - A character value descriptor for the column name on the left */
/*          side of the query. */


/*        - An operator code indicating the relational operator used */
/*          in the constraint. */


/*        If the constraint compares values from two columns, the */
/*        next items are table and column name descriptors that apply to */
/*        the column named on the right side of the relational operator. */


/*        If the constraint has a literal value on the right side, the */
/*        operator code is followed by... */

/*        - a value descriptor. */


/*        - Size of a constraint descriptor: */


/*     Conjunction sizes */
/*     ----------------- */

/*     The size of each conjunction of constraints occupies a single */
/*     integer. */




/*     Order-by Column Descriptors */
/*     --------------------------- */

/*     Each order-by column descriptor contains descriptors for */
/*     the table containing the column and for the name of the column */
/*     itself; one additional element is used to indicate the direction */
/*     of the ordering (ascending vs descending). */


/*        - The last integer in the descriptor indicates whether the */
/*          order direction is ascending or descending. */


/*        - Size of an order-by column descriptor: */


/*     Codes indicating sense of ordering (ascending vs descending): */


/*     SELECT Column Descriptors */
/*     --------------------------- */

/*     Each SELECT column descriptor contains descriptors for */
/*     the table containing the column and for the name of the column */
/*     itself. */


/*        - Size of a SELECT column descriptor: */


/*     Miscellaneous parameters: */


/*     EQIMIN is the minimum size of the integer portion of */
/*     an encoded query.  EQIMIN depends on the parameters */

/*        MAXTAB */
/*        MAXCON */
/*        MAXORD */
/*        MAXSEL */

/*     all of which are declared in the include file ekqlimit.inc. */
/*     The functional definition of EQIMIN is: */

/*     INTEGER               EQIMIN */
/*     PARAMETER           ( EQIMIN =   EQVBAS */
/*    .                              +  MAXTAB * EQVDSZ * 2 */
/*    .                              +  MAXCON * EQCDSZ */
/*    .                              +  MAXCON */
/*    .                              +  MAXORD * EQODSZ */
/*    .                              +  MAXSEL * EQSDSZ     ) */

/* $ Detailed_Input */

/*     QUERY          is a character string that specifies a set of EK */
/*                    data to select from those present in currently */
/*                    loaded EK files.  The selected data will be */
/*                    retrievable via the EK fetch routines EKGC, EKGD, */
/*                    and EKGI. */

/*                    The query consists of four clauses, the third and */
/*                    fourth of which are optional.  The general form */
/*                    of a query is */

/*                       SELECT <column list> */
/*                       FROM <table list> */
/*                       [WHERE <constraint list>] */
/*                       [ORDER BY <ORDER BY column list>] */

/*                    where brackets indicate optional items.  The */
/*                    elements of the query shown above are called, */
/*                    respectively, the `SELECT clause', the */
/*                    `FROM clause', the `WHERE clause', and the */
/*                    `ORDER BY clause'.  The result of a query may be */
/*                    thought of as a new table, whose columns are those */
/*                    specified in the SELECT clause, whose rows are */
/*                    those satisfying the constraints of the WHERE */
/*                    clause, and whose rows are ordered according to */
/*                    the ORDER BY clause. */

/*                    The SELECT clause specifies a list of columns */
/*                    from which data are to be selected.  In a simple */
/*                    (non-join) query, these columns must belong to */
/*                    the single table specified in the FROM clause. */

/*                    The form of a SELECT clause is */

/*                       SELECT <column name> [ ,<column name>...] */

/*                    In queries having multiple tables in the FROM */
/*                    clause, column names are ambiguous if they occur */
/*                    in more than one table in the FROM clause.  Such */
/*                    column names must be qualified with table */
/*                    identifiers.  These identifiers may be the names of */
/*                    the tables to which the columns belong, or table */
/*                    `aliases', names (usually short ones) associated */
/*                    with tables in the FROM clause.  Table aliases have */
/*                    duration limited to the execution of the query to */
/*                    which they belong. */

/*                    The form of a qualified column name is */

/*                       <table name>.<column name> */

/*                    or */

/*                       <table alias>.<column name> */


/*                    The FROM clause specifies the tables from which */
/*                    data are to be selected.  In simple queries, only */
/*                    one table is listed.  In this case the form of */
/*                    the FROM clause is */

/*                       FROM <table name> */

/*                    In queries involving multiple tables, the form of */
/*                    the FROM clause becomes */

/*                       FROM <table name> [<table alias>] */
/*                            [ , <table name> [<table alias>] ... ] */

/*                    The aliases associated with the table names must */
/*                    be distinct and must not be the actual names of */
/*                    loaded EK tables. */

/*                    Queries involving multiple tables are called */
/*                    `joins'. */

/*                    The meaning of a FROM clause containing multiple */
/*                    tables is that the output is to be a subset of */
/*                    the rows of the Cartesian product of the listed */
/*                    tables.  Normally, WHERE clause constraints are */
/*                    supplied to reduce the selected rows to a set of */
/*                    interest. */

/*                    The most common example of a join is a query with */
/*                    two tables listed in the FROM clause, and a WHERE */
/*                    clause constraint enforcing equality of members */
/*                    of a column in the first table with members of */
/*                    column in the second table.  Such a query is */
/*                    called an `equi-join'.  A join in which columns */
/*                    of different tables are related by an inequality */
/*                    is called a `non-equi-join'.  Any type of join */
/*                    other than an equi-join may be very slow to */
/*                    evaluate, due to the large number of elements that */
/*                    may be contained in the Cartesian */
/*                    product of the listed tables. */

/*                    The WHERE clause lists constraints that must */
/*                    be met by each row satisfying the query.  The */
/*                    constraints are specified as a logical combination */
/*                    of relational expressions.  The form of the */
/*                    constraint list is */

/*                       WHERE <constraint expression> */

/*                    where each <constraint expression> consists of one */
/*                    or more simple relational expressions of the form */

/*                       <column name> <operator> <RHS symbol> */

/*                    where */

/*                       <RHS symbol> */

/*                    is a column name, a literal value, or the special */
/*                    symbol */

/*                       NULL */

/*                    and */

/*                       <operator> */

/*                    is any of */

/*                       EQ, GE, GT, LE, LIKE, LT, NE, NOT LIKE, <, <=, */
/*                       =, >, >=, !=, <> */

/*                    For comparison with null values, the special */
/*                    syntaxes */

/*                       <column name> IS NULL */
/*                       <column name> IS NOT NULL */

/*                    are allowed, in addition to the standard */
/*                    comparison syntaxes using the equality or */
/*                    inequality operators. */

/*                    The LIKE operator allows comparison of a string */
/*                    value against a template.  The template syntax */
/*                    is that allowed by the SPICELIB routine MATCHI. */
/*                    Templates may include literal characters, the */
/*                    wild string marker '*', and the wild character */
/*                    marker '%'.  Case is significant in templates. */

/*                    Templates are bracketed by quote characters, just */
/*                    as are literal strings. */

/*                    The query language also supports the BETWEEN and */
/*                    NOT BETWEEN constructs */

/*                       <column> BETWEEN <symbol 1> AND <symbol 2> */

/*                       <column> NOT BETWEEN <symbol 1> AND <symbol 2> */

/*                    The tokens */

/*                       <symbol 1> */
/*                       <symbol 2> */

/*                    may be literal values or column names. */

/*                    The BETWEEN operator considers values that match */
/*                    the bounds to satisfy the condition:  the BETWEEN */
/*                    operator tests for inclusion in the closed interval */
/*                    defined by the bounds. */

/*                    In the WHERE clause, simple relational expressions */
/*                    may be combined using the logical operators AND, */
/*                    OR, and NOT, as in the Fortran programming */
/*                    language.  Parentheses may be used to enforce a */
/*                    desired order of evaluation of logical expressions. */

/*                    The expression syntax is NOT symmetric:  literal */
/*                    values must not appear on the left hand side of the */
/*                    operators that apply to them. */

/*                    The columns named in a constraint clause must */
/*                    belong to the tables listed in the FROM clause. */
/*                    If the query is a join, qualifying table names or */
/*                    aliases are required wherever their omission would */
/*                    result in ambiguity. */

/*                    Data types of the columns or constants used on the */
/*                    right-hand-sides of operators must match the data */
/*                    types of the corresponding columns on the */
/*                    left-hand-sides, except that comparison of integer */
/*                    and double precision quantities is permitted. */

/*                    Literal strings used in constraints are always */
/*                    bracketed by quotes.  Either single  quotes (') */
/*                    or double quotes (") may be used, but the same */
/*                    quote character must be used to start and end any */
/*                    literal string. Within character string values, */
/*                    quote characters must be doubled in order to be */
/*                    recognized.  Case is significant in character */
/*                    except in comparisions using the LIKE and NOT LIKE */
/*                    operators, which ignore case:  the expression */

/*                    For each ORDER BY column, the keywords ASC or DESC */
/*                    may be supplied to indicate whether the items in */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*     1)  Most of the exceptions that can occur on a call to */

/*         attempts to diagnose these via the output error flag and */
/*         error message, instead of signalling errors.  The following */
/*         classes of errors are detected: */

/*            Scanning errors---these result from badly formed query */
/*            in which EKFIND could not identify all of the tokens. */
/*            When these errors occur, EKFIND may be too confused to */
/*            give a helpful diagnostic message. */

/*            Parsing errors---these result from a badly formed */
/*            query that EKFIND was able to separate into tokens */
/*            but that EKFIND determined to be syntactically invalid: */

/*            Name resolution errors---these result from referencing */
/*            invalid or ambiguous column or table names in a query. */

/*     EKQMGR or the EK Required Reading for examples of use of this */

/*         In the following examples, we'll assume that the program */
