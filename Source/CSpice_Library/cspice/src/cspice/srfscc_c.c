   srfstr     I   Surface name or ID string. 
   bodyid     I   Body ID code. 
   code       O   Integer surface ID code. 
   found      O   Flag indicating whether surface ID was found. 
 
-Detailed_Input
 
   srfstr     is a string designating a surface. `srfstr' may contain 
              a surface name or a string representation of the 
              surface's integer ID code. 
 
              Case and leading and trailing blanks in a surface name 
              are not significant. Sequences of consecutive embedded
              blanks are considered equivalent to a single blank. For
              example, all of the strings below are considered to be
              equivalent:

                 "MGS MOLA 128 PIXEL/DEG" 
                 "MGS MOLA 128 pixel/deg" 
                 "MGS MOLA 128 PIXEL/DEG   " 
                 "MGS MOLA 128    PIXEL/DEG" 
                 "   MGS MOLA 128 PIXEL/DEG" 
 
              However,  
 
                 "MGSMOLA 128PIXEL/DEG"  
 
              is not equivalent to the names above. 
 
 
   bodyid     is the integer ID code of the body associated with the 
              surface designated by `srfstr'. 
 
-Detailed_Output
 
   code       is integer ID code of the surface designated by `srfstr',
              for the body designated by `bodyid', if for this body an
              association exists between the input surface string and a
              surface ID code. `code' is defined if and only if the
              output flag `found' is SPICETRUE.
 
   found      is a logical flag that is SPICETRUE if a surface code 
              corresponding to the input surface string and body ID 
              code was found. `found' is SPICEFALSE otherwise. 
 
-Parameters
 
   None. 
 
-Exceptions
 
   1)  If the input surface string does not map to an ID code 
       and does not represent an integer, the output `code' is 
       undefined and the output `found' is set to SPICEFALSE.
 
       This case is not treated as an error. 
 
   2)  The error SPICE(EMPTYSTRING) is signaled if the input string
       does not contain at least one character, since such an input
       string cannot be converted to a Fortran-style string in this
       case.
 
   3)  The error SPICE(NULLPOINTER) is signaled if the input string
       pointer is null.

-Files
   
   Surface name-to-ID mappings may be defined at run time by loading
   text kernels containing kernel variable assignments of the form
 
      NAIF_SURFACE_NAME += ( <surface name 1>, ... ) 
      NAIF_SURFACE_CODE += ( <surface code 1>, ... ) 
      NAIF_SURFACE_BODY += ( <body code 1>,    ... ) 
 
   Above, the Ith elements of the lists on the assignments' right
   hand sides together define the Ith surface name/ID mapping.
 
   The same effect can be achieved using assignments formatted as 
   follows: 
 
      NAIF_SURFACE_NAME += <surface name 1> 
      NAIF_SURFACE_CODE += <surface code 1> 
      NAIF_SURFACE_BODY += <body code 1> 
 
      NAIF_SURFACE_NAME += <surface name 2> 
      NAIF_SURFACE_CODE += <surface code 2> 
      NAIF_SURFACE_BODY += <body code 2> 
 
         ... 
 
   Note the use of the 
 
      += 
 
   operator; this operator appends to rather than overwrites the 
   kernel variable named on the left hand side of the assignment. 
 
-Particulars
 
   Surfaces are always associated with bodies (which usually are 
   ephemeris objects). For any given body, a mapping between surface 
   names and surface ID codes can be established.  
 
   Bodies serve to disambiguate surface names and ID codes: the set 
   of surface names and surface ID codes for a given body can be 
   thought of as belonging to a name space. A given surface ID code 
   or surface name may be used for surfaces of multiple bodies, 
   without conflict. 
 
   Associations between surface names and ID codes are always made 
   via kernel pool assignments; there are no built-in associations. 
 
   srfscc_c is one of four related subroutines: 
 
      srfs2c_c    Surface string and body string to surface ID code 
      srfscc_c    Surface string and body ID code to surface ID code 
      srfc2s_c    Surface ID code and body ID code to surface string 
      srfcss_c    Surface ID code and body string to surface string 
 
   srfs2c_c, srfc2s_c, srfscc_c, and srfcss_c perform translations
   between surface strings and their corresponding integer ID codes.
 
   Refer to naif_ids.req for details concerning adding new surface 
   name/code associations at run time by loading text kernels. 

-Examples
 
   The formatting of the results shown for this example may differ 
   across platforms. 
 
   1) Supposed a text kernel has been loaded that contains 
      the following assignments: 
 
         NAIF_SURFACE_NAME += ( 'MGS MOLA  64 pixel/deg', 
                                'MGS MOLA 128 pixel/deg', 
                                'PHOBOS GASKELL Q512'     ) 
         NAIF_SURFACE_CODE += (   1,   2,    1 ) 
         NAIF_SURFACE_BODY += ( 499, 499,  401 ) 
 
      Translate each surface and body string pair to the  
      associated surface ID code. Also perform a translation 
      for a surface name having no matching ID and for  
      a body string having no matching body ID code.
