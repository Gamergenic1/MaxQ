/*      RIGHT      I   Right delimiter. */
/*      OUT        O   Output (quoted) string. */

/* $ Detailed_Input */

/*      IN          is the input string to be quoted. */

/*      LEFT, */
/*      RIGHT       are the left and right delimiters to be used in */
/*                  quoting the input string. These may be the same */
/*                  character (apostrophe, vertical bar), complementary */
/*                  characters (left and right parentheses, brackets, */
/*                  or braces), or two totally unrelated characters. */

/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*      OUT         is the output string. This is the non-blank part */
/*                  of the input string delimited by LEFT and RIGHT. */
/*                  If the output string is not large enough to contain */
/*                  the quoted string, it is truncated on the right. */
/*                  (The right delimiter would be lost in this case.) */

/*                  If the input string is blank, the output string is */
/*                  a single quoted blank. */

/*                  OUT may overwrite IN. */

/* $ Parameters */

/*     None. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*      The first character of the output string is the left delimiter, */
/*      LEFT. This is followed immediately by the non-blank part of the */
/*      input string, which is in turn followed by the right delimiter, */
/*      RIGHT. */

/*      If the input string is blank (has no non-blank characters), */
/*      a single quoted blank is returned. */

/* $ Examples */

/*      Let */
/*            IN    = '    This string has leading and trailing blanks  ' */
/*            LEFT  = '(' */
/*            RIGHT = ')' */

/*      Then */
/*            OUT   = '(This string has leading and trailing blanks)    ' */

/*      Or, let IN = '         '. Then OUT = '( )'. */
