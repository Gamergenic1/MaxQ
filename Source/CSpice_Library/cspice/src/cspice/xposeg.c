/* $ Particulars */

/*     This routine transposes the input matrix MATRIX and writes the */
/*     result to the matrix XPOSEM.  This algorithm is performed in */
/*     such a way that the transpose can be performed in place.  That */
/*     is, MATRIX and XPOSEM can use the same storage area in memory. */

/*     NOTE:  The matrices MATRIX and XPOSEM are declared */
/*            one-dimensional for computational purposes only.  The */
/*            calling program should declare them as MATRIX(NROW,NCOL) */
/*            and XPOSEM(NCOL,NROW). */

/*            This routine works on the assumption that the input and */
/*            output matrices are defined as described above.  More */
/*            specifically it assuses that the elements of the matrix */
/*            to be transformed is stored in contiguous memory locations */
/*            as shown here.  On output these elements will be */
/*            rearranged in consecutive memory locations as shown. */

/*     For those familiar with permutations, this algorithm relies */
/*     upon the fact that the transposition of a matrix, which has */
/*     been stored as a string, is simply the action of a */
/*     permutation applied to that string.  Since any permutation */
/*     can be decomposed as a product of disjoint cycles, it is */
/*     possible to transpose the matrix with only one additional */
/*     storage register.  However, once a cycle has been computed */
/*     it is necessary to find the next entry in the string that */
/*     has not been moved by the permutation.  For this reason the */
/*     algorithm is slower than would be necessary if the numbers */
/*     of rows and columns were known in advance. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     This routine is primarily useful when attempting to transpose */
/*     large matrices, where inplace transposition is important.  For */
/*     example suppose you have the following declarations */

/*         DOUBLE PRECISION      MATRIX ( 1003, 800  ) */

/*     If the transpose of the matrix is needed, it may not be */
/*     possible to fit a second matrix requiring the same storage */
/*     into memory.  Instead declare XPOSEM as below and use */
/*     an equivalence so that the same area of memory is allocated. */

/*         DOUBLE PRECISION      XPOSEM (  800, 1003 ) */
/*         EQUIVALENCE         ( MATRIX (1,1), XPOSEM(1,1) ) */

/*     To obtain the transpose simply execute */

/*         CALL XPOSEG ( MATRIX, 1003, 800, XPOSEM ) */
