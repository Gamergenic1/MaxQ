/*     Note that if the target-observer vector, the target normal vector */

/*     true; usually */

/*        phase angle  <  solar incidence angle + emission angle */

/*     All of the above angles can be computed using light time */
/*     corrections, light time and stellar aberration corrections, or */
/*     no aberration corrections.  The way aberration corrections */
/*     are used is described below. */

/*     Care must be used in computing light time corrections.  The */
/*     guiding principle used here is "describe what appears in */
/*     an image."  We ignore differential light time; the light times */
/*     from all points on the target to the observer are presumed to be */
/*     equal. */


/*        Observer-target body vector */
/*        --------------------------- */

/*        Let ET be the epoch at which an observation or remote */
/*        sensing measurement is made, and let ET - LT ("LT" stands */
/*        for "light time") be the epoch at which the photons received */
/*        at ET were emitted from the body (we use the term "emitted" */
/*        loosely here). */

/*        The correct observer-target vector points from the observer's */
/*        location at ET to the target body's location at ET - LT. */
/*        The target-observer vector points in the opposite direction. */

/*        Since light time corrections are not symmetric, the correct */
/*        target-observer vector CANNOT be found by computing the light */
/*        time corrected position of the observer as seen from the */
/*        target body. */


/*        Target body's orientation */
/*        ------------------------- */

/*        Using the definitions of ET and LT above, the target */
/*        body's orientation at ET - LT is used.  The surface */
/*        normal is dependent on the target body's orientation, so */
/*        the body's orientation model must be evaluated for the correct */
/*        epoch. */


/*        Target body -- Sun vector */
/*        ------------------------- */

/*        All surface features on the target body will appear in */
/*        a measurement made at ET as they were at ET-LT.  In */
/*        particular, lighting on the target body is dependent on */
/*        the apparent location of the Sun as seen from the target */
/*        body at ET-LT.  So, a second light time correction is used */
/*        in finding the apparent location of the Sun. */


/*     Stellar aberration corrections, when used, are applied as follows: */


/*        Observer-target body vector */
/*        --------------------------- */

/*        In addition to light time correction, stellar aberration is */
/*        used in computing the apparent target body position as seen */
/*        from the observer's location at time ET.  This apparent */
/*        position defines the observer-target body vector. */


/*        Target body-Sun vector */
/*        ---------------------- */

/*        The target body-Sun vector is the apparent position of the Sun, */
/*        corrected for light time and stellar aberration, as seen from */
/*        the target body at time ET-LT.  Note that the target body's */
/*        position is not affected by the stellar aberration correction */
/*        applied in finding its apparent position as seen by the */
/*        observer. */


/*     Once all of the vectors, as well as the target body's */
/*     orientation, have been computed with the proper aberration */
/*     corrections, the element of time is eliminated from the */
/*     computation.  The problem becomes a purely geometrical one, */
/*     and is described by the diagram above. */
