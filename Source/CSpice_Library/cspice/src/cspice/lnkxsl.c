/*     HEAD, */
/*     TAIL       I   Head and tail nodes of a sublist to be extracted. */
/*     POOL      I-O  A doubly linked list pool. */

/* $ Detailed_Input */

/*     HEAD, */
/*     TAIL           are, respectively, the head and tail nodes of a */
/*                    sublist to be extracted. */

/*     POOL           is a doubly linked list pool. */

/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*     POOL           is the input pool, with the following */
/*                    modifications: */

/*                       -- The sublist bounded by HEAD and */
/*                          by TAIL is now a separate list from */
/*                          the list that originally contained it. */

/*                       If on input, HEAD was preceded by the node */
/*                       PREV, and tail was followed by the node */
/*                       NEXT, then on output */

/*                       -- The successor of PREV is NEXT. */
/*                       -- The predecessor of NEXT is PREV. */


/* $ Parameters */

/*     LBPOOL        is the lower bound of the column indices of the POOL */
/*                   array.  The columns indexed LBPOOL to 0 are reserved */
/*                   as a control area for the pool. */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*     1)  If either of HEAD or TAIL are not valid node numbers, the */
/*         error SPICE(INVALIDNODE) will be signalled.  POOL will not be */
/*         modified. */

/*     2)  If either of HEAD or TAIL are valid node numbers but are */
/*         not allocated, the error SPICE(UNALLOCATEDNODE) will be */
/*         signalled.  POOL will not be modified. */

/*     3)  If TAIL cannot be reached by forward traversal of the list */
/*         containing HEAD, the error SPICE(INVALIDSUBLIST) is signalled. */
/*         POOL will not be modified. */

/* $ Files */

/*     None. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     Extracting a sublist from a list is necessary when a list is */
/*     to be re-arranged in some way.  For example, to move a node */
/*     in a list to the head of the list, the node (which is a */
/*     singleton sublist) is first extracted from the list containing */
/*     it, then inserted before the head of the list. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     1)  Let POOL be a doubly linked list pool, and let */

/*            9 <--> 8 <--> 4 <--> 2000 <--> 1 */

/*         be a list in POOL.  To extract the sublist */

/*            4 <--> 2000 */

/*         the call */

/*            CALL LNKXSL ( 4, 2000, POOL ) */

/*         can be used.  After the call is made, POOL will contain the */
/*         separate lists */

/*            9 <--> 8 <--> 1 */

/*         and */

/*            4 <--> 2000 */


/*     2)  Let POOL be a doubly linked list pool, and let */

/*            9 <--> 8 <--> 4 <--> 2000 <--> 1 */

/*         be a list in POOL.  To move the node 2000 to the */
/*         head of the list, the code fragment */

/*            CALL LNKXSL ( 2000, 2000, POOL ) */
/*            CALL LNKILB ( 2000, 9,    POOL ) */

/*         can be used.  The resulting list will be */

/*            2000 <--> 9 <--> 8 <--> 4 <--> 1 */


/* $ Restrictions */

/*     Linked list pools must be initialized via the routine */
/*     LNKINI.  Failure to initialize a linked list pool */
/*     will almost certainly lead to confusing results. */
