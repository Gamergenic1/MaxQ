/* $ Detailed_Input */

/*     TARG        is the NAIF ID code for a target body.  The target */
/*                 and observer define a state vector whose position */
/*                 component points from the observer to the target. */

/*     ET          is the ephemeris time, expressed as seconds past */
/*                 J2000 TDB, at which the state of the target body */
/*                 relative to the observer is to be computed. ET */
/*                 refers to time at the observer's location. */

/*     REF         is the inertial reference frame with respect to which */
/*                 the input state STOBS and the output state STARG are */
/*                 expressed. REF must be recognized by the SPICE */
/*                 Toolkit. The acceptable frames are listed in the */
/*                 Frames Required Reading, as well as in the SPICELIB */
/*                 routine CHGIRF. */

/*                 Case and blanks are not significant in the string */
/*                 REF. */


/*     ABCORR      indicates the aberration corrections to be applied to */
/*                 the state of the target body to account for one-way */
/*                 light time. See the discussion in the Particulars */
/*                 section for recommendations on how to choose */
/*                 aberration corrections. */

/*                 If ABCORR includes the stellar aberration correction */
/*                 symbol '+S', this flag is simply ignored. Aside from */
/*                 the possible presence of this symbol, ABCORR may be */
/*                 any of the following: */

/*                    'NONE'     Apply no correction. Return the */

/*                               relative to the observer. */

/*                 The following values of ABCORR apply to the */

/*                 target's location at the light-time corrected epoch */
/*                 ET-LT and *arrive* at the observer's location at ET: */

/*                               Newtonian formulation. This correction */
/*                               yields the state of the target at the */

/*                               the observer at ET. */

/*                               The light time correction involves */

/*                               equation, the 'CN' correction iterates */
/*                               until the solution converges (three */
/*                               iterations on all supported platforms). */
/*                               Whether the 'CN+S' solution is */

/*                               formulation. This correction yields the */

/*     STOBS       is the geometric (uncorrected) state of the observer */
/*                 relative to the solar system barycenter at epoch ET. */
/*                 STOBS is a 6-vector: the first three components of */

/*                 three components represent the corresponding velocity */
/*                 vector. STOBS is expressed relative to the inertial */
/*                 reference frame designated by REF. */

/*                 Units are always km and km/sec. */

/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*     STARG       is a Cartesian state vector representing the position */
/*                 and velocity of the target body relative to the */
/*                 specified observer. STARG is corrected for the */
/*                 specified aberration, and is expressed with respect */
/*                 to the specified inertial reference frame.  The first */
/*                 three components of STARG represent the x-, y- and */
/*                 z-components of the target's position; last three */
/*                 components form the corresponding velocity vector. */

/*                 The position component of STARG points from the */
/*                 observer's location at ET to the aberration-corrected */
/*                 location of the target. Note that the sense of the */
/*                 position vector is independent of the direction of */
/*                 radiation travel implied by the aberration */
/*                 correction. */

/*                 Units are always km and km/sec. */

/*     LT          is the one-way light time between the observer and */
/*                 target in seconds.  If the target state is corrected */
/*                 for light time, then LT is the one-way light time */
/*                 between the observer and the light time-corrected */
/*                 target location. */

/*     DLT         is the derivative with respect to barycentric */
/*                 dynamical time of the one way light time between */
/*                 target and observer: */

/*                    DLT = d(LT)/d(ET) */

/*                 DLT can also be described as the rate of change of */
/*                 one way light time. DLT is unitless, since LT and */
/*                 ET both have units of TDB seconds. */

/*                 If the observer and target are at the same position, */
/*                 then DLT is set to zero. */

/* $ Parameters */

/*     None. */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*     1) For the convenience of the caller, the input aberration */
/*        correction flag can call for stellar aberration correction via */
/*        inclusion of the '+S' suffix. This portion of the aberration */
/*        correction flag is ignored if present. */

/*     2) If the value of ABCORR is not recognized, the error */
/*        is diagnosed by a routine in the call tree of this */
/*        routine. */

/*     3) If the reference frame requested is not a recognized */
/*        inertial reference frame, the error SPICE(BADFRAME) */
/*        is signaled. */

/*     4) If the state of the target relative to the solar system */
/*        barycenter cannot be computed, the error will be diagnosed */
/*        by routines in the call tree of this routine. */

/*     5) If the observer and target are at the same position, */
/*        then DLT is set to zero. This situation could arise, */
/*        for example, when the observer is Mars and the target */
/*        is the Mars barycenter. */

/*     6) If a division by zero error would occur in the computation */
/*        of DLT, the error SPICE(DIVIDEBYZERO) is signaled. */

/* $ Files */

/*     This routine computes states using SPK files that have been */
/*     loaded into the SPICE system, normally via the kernel loading */
/*     interface routine FURNSH.  Application programs typically load */
/*     kernels once before this routine is called, for example during */
/*     program initialization; kernels need not be loaded repeatedly. */
/*     See the routine FURNSH and the SPK and KERNEL Required Reading */
/*     for further information on loading (and unloading) kernels. */

/*     If any of the ephemeris data used to compute STARG are expressed */
/*     relative to a non-inertial frame in the SPK files providing those */
/*     data, additional kernels may be needed to enable the reference */
/*     frame transformations required to compute the state. Normally */
/*     these additional kernels are PCK files or frame kernels. Any */
/*     such kernels must already be loaded at the time this routine is */
/*     called. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     This routine supports higher-level SPK API routines that can */
/*     perform both light time and stellar aberration corrections. */
/*     User applications normally will not need to call this routine */
/*     directly. */

/*     See the header of the routine SPKEZR for a detailed discussion */
/*     of aberration corrections. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     The numerical results shown for this example may differ across */
/*     platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as */
/*     input, the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine */
/*     specific arithmetic implementation. */

/*    1) Look up a sequence of states of the Moon as seen from the */
/*       Earth. Use light time corrections. Compute the first state for */
/*       the epoch 2000 JAN 1 12:00:00 TDB; compute subsequent states at */
/*       intervals of 1 hour. For each epoch, display the states, the */
/*       one way light time between target and observer, and the rate of */
/*       change of the one way light time. */

/*       Use the following meta-kernel to specify the kernels to */
/*       load: */

/*          KPL/MK */

/*          File name: spkltc.tm */

/*     1) The routine SPKGEO should be used instead of this routine */

/*        center that is closer to both objects than is the solar */

/*     2) The kernel files to be used by SPKLTC must be loaded */
/*        (normally by the SPICELIB kernel loader FURNSH) before */
/*        this routine is called. */

/*     3) Unlike most other SPK state computation routines, this */
