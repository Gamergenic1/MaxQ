/*     --------  ---  --------------------------------------------------- */
/*     MODULE     I   The name of the calling routine. */
/*     FILEN      P   Maximum length of file name. */

/* $ Detailed_Input */

/*     MODULE         is the name of the routine calling CHKIN.  The */
/*                    named routine is supposed to be `checking in' */
/*                    when it calls CHKIN; that is, the call should be */
/*                    the first executable statement following the */
/*                    reference to the function RETURN (which should be */
/*                    the first executable statement). */

/*                    Only the first NAMLEN non-blank characters in */
/*                    a module name are stored for use in a traceback */
/*                    by this subroutine. */

/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*     None. */

/* $ Parameters */

/*     FILEN          is the maximum file name length that can be */
/*                    accommodated by this routine. */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*     CHKIN does not signal errors; rather it writes error messages, */
/*     so as to avoid recursion. */


/*     1)  If the traceback storage area overflows, the short error */
/*         message SPICE(TRACEBACKOVERFLOW) is written to the error */
/*         output device. */

/*     2)  If the input argument MODULE is blank, the short error message */
/*         SPICE(BLANKMODULENAME) is written to the error output device. */

/* $ Files */

/*     None. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     This routine is part of the SPICELIB error handling mechanism. */

/*     Conceptually, the effect of this routine is to `push' the */
/*     supplied module name onto a stack.  The routine CHKOUT performs */
/*     the inverse, or `pop', operation. */

/*     Every routine that participates in the traceback scheme should */
/*     have a call to CHKIN as the second executable statement.  The */
/*     first executable statements should be: */

/*        IF ( RETURN() ) THEN */
/*           RETURN */
/*        ELSE */
/*           CALL CHKIN ( module ) */
/*        END IF */

/*     Here module is the name of the routine in which this code appears. */

/*     The line of code preceding the END or any RETURN statement should */
/*     be */

/*         CALL CHKOUT ( module ) */


/*     All SPICELIB routines should call CHKIN and CHKOUT, unless they */
/*     are classified as `error free'.  Programs linked with SPICELIB */
/*     may also use CHKIN and CHKOUT. */

/*     Routines that don't call CHKIN and CHKOUT won't appear in the */
/*     traceback. */

/*     All routines that call CHKIN must also call CHKOUT, or else the */
/*     trace mechanism will become very confused. */

/*     It is possible to disable check-ins (and check-outs) by calling */
/*     the entry point TRCOFF.  CHKIN and CHKOUT will return immediately */
/*     upon entry after TRCOFF has been called.  It is not possible to */
/*     re-enable check-ins and check-outs after calling TRCOFF. Routines */
/*     that don't call CHKIN and CHKOUT won't appear in the traceback. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     FILEN      P   Maximum file name length. */

/* $ Detailed_Input */

/*     MODULE         is the name of the routine calling CHKOUT.  The */
/*                    named routine is supposed to be `checking out' */
/*                    when it calls CHKOUT; that is, the call should be */
/*                    the last executable statement preceding any exit */
/*                    from the routine. */

/*                    Only the first NAMLEN non-blank characters in */
/*                    a module name are used when checking out. */

/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*     None. */

/* $ Parameters */

/*     FILEN          is the maximum file name length that can be */
/*                    accommodated by this routine. */

/*     NAMLEN         is the maximum module name length that can be */
/*                    accommodated by this routine. */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*     CHKOUT does not signal errors; rather it writes error messages, */
/*     so as to avoid recursion. */

/*     1)  If the input module name MODULE does not match the name popped */
/*         from the trace stack, the short error message */
/*         SPICE(NAMESDONOTMATCH) is written to the error output device. */

/*     2)  If the trace stack is empty, the short error message */
/*         SPICE(TRACESTACKEMPTY) is written to the error output device. */

/* $ Files */

/*     None. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     This routine is part of the SPICELIB error handling mechanism. */

/*     Conceptually, the effect of this routine is to `pop' a module */
/*     name from a stack.  The routine CHKIN performs the inverse, or */
/*     `push' operation. */

/*     Every routine that participates in the traceback scheme should */
/*     have a call to CHKIN as the second executable statement. */
/*     The first executable statements should be: */

/*        IF ( RETURN() ) THEN */
/*           RETURN */
/*        ELSE */
/*           CALL CHKIN ( module ) */
/*        END IF */

/*     Here module is the name of the routine in which this code appears. */

/*     The line of code preceding the END or any RETURN statement */
/*     should be */

/*        CALL CHKOUT  ( module ) */

/*     All SPICELIB routines should call CHKIN and CHKOUT, unless they */
/*     are classified as `error free'.  Programs linked with SPICELIB */
/*     may also use CHKIN and CHKOUT. */

/*     Routines that don't call CHKIN and CHKOUT won't appear in the */
/*     traceback. */

/*     All routines that call CHKIN must also call CHKOUT, or else the */
/*     trace mechanism will become very confused. */

/*     It is possible to disable check-ins (and check-outs) by calling */
/*     the entry point TRCOFF.  CHKIN and CHKOUT will return immediately */
/*     upon entry after TRCOFF has been called.  It is not possible to */
/*     re-enable check-ins and check-outs after calling TRCOFF. Routines */
/*     that don't call CHKIN and CHKOUT won't appear in the traceback. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     1)  Call CHKOUT before a RETURN statement: */

/*            IF ( FAILED() ) THEN */
/*               CALL CHKOUT ( module ) */
/*               RETURN */
/*            END IF */


/*     2)  Call CHKOUT before an END statement: */

/*            CALL CHKOUT ( module ) */
/*            END */


/*     3)  Only ONE call to CHKOUT is needed here: */

/*            CALL CHKOUT ( module ) */
/*            RETURN */
/*            END */

/* $ Restrictions */

/*     Routines that call this routine must call CHKIN as the second */
/*     executable statement. (The first is a call to RETURN). */

/*     TRACE      O   A traceback report. */

/* $ Detailed_Input */

/*     None. */

/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*     TRACE          is a list of module names, delimited by the */
/*                    string, ' -->'.  An example would be */

/*                       'SPUD -->SPAM -->FOOBAR'. */

/*                    In general, the meaning of the trace is as */
/*                    follows: */

/*                    The first name in the list is the name of the first */
/*                    module to check in (that hasn't yet checked out). */
/*                    The last name is the name of the module at the end */
/*                    of the call chain; this is the last module that */
/*                    checked in. */

/*                    The meaning of the traceback depends on the state */
/*                    of the error handling mechanism.  There are two */
/*                    cases: */

/*                       1.  In 'RETURN' mode, when an error is */
/*                           signaled, the traceback at that point is */
/*                           saved.  TRCDEP, TRCNAM, and QCKTRC will */
/*                           return values pertaining to the saved */
/*                           traceback. */

/*                       2.  In all other modes, the traceback represents */
/*                           the CURRENT call chain.  TRCDEP, TRCNAM, */
/*                           and QCKTRC will return values pertaining to */
/*                           the current trace representation. */

/*                    Any module names exceeding NAMLEN characters in */
/*                    length are truncated on the right. */

/* $ Parameters */

/*     FILEN          is the maximum file name length that can be */
/*                    accommodated by this routine. */

/*           C     user-defined routine, USER_ERROR. */
/*           C */

/*                 CALL RDTEXT ( FILE, LINE, EOF ) */
