/*                 from the observer to the target. */

/*     ET          is the ephemeris time, expressed as seconds past */
/*                 J2000 TDB, at which the position of the target body */
/*                 relative to the observer is to be computed.  ET */
/*                 refers to time at the observer's location. */

/*     REF         is the inertial reference frame with respect to which */
/*                 the observer's state SOBS is expressed. REF must be */

/*                 Case and blanks are not significant in the string REF. */

/*     SOBS        is the geometric (uncorrected) state of the observer */
/*                 relative to the solar system barycenter at epoch ET. */
/*                 SOBS is a 6-vector:  the first three components of */

/* $ Files */


/*     This routine computes positions using SPK files that have been */
/*     loaded into the SPICE system, normally via the kernel loading */
/*     interface routine FURNSH.  Application programs typically load */
/*     kernels once before this routine is called, for example during */
/*     program initialization; kernels need not be loaded repeatedly. */
/*     See the routine FURNSH and the SPK and KERNEL Required Reading */
/*     for further information on loading (and unloading) kernels. */

/*     If any of the ephemeris data used to compute PTARG are expressed */
/*     relative to a non-inertial frame in the SPK files providing those */
/*     data, additional kernels may be needed to enable the reference */
/*     frame transformations required to compute PTARG.  Normally */
/*     these additional kernels are PCK files or frame kernels.  Any */
/*     such kernels must already be loaded at the time this routine is */
/*     called. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     In space science or engineering applications one frequently */
/*     wishes to know where to point a remote sensing instrument, such */
/*     as an optical camera or radio antenna, in order to observe or */
/*     otherwise receive radiation from a target.  This pointing problem */
/*     is complicated by the finite speed of light:  one needs to point */
/*     to where the target appears to be as opposed to where it actually */
/*     is at the epoch of observation.  We use the adjectives */
/*     "geometric," "uncorrected," or "true" to refer to an actual */
/*     position or state of a target at a specified epoch.  When a */
/*     geometric position or state vector is modified to reflect how it */
/*     appears to an observer, we describe that vector by any of the */
/*     terms "apparent," "corrected," "aberration corrected," or "light */
/*     time and stellar aberration corrected." */

/*     The SPICE Toolkit can correct for two phenomena affecting the */
/*     apparent location of an object:  one-way light time (also called */
/*     "planetary aberration") and stellar aberration.  Correcting for */
/*     one-way light time is done by computing, given an observer and */
/*     observation epoch, where a target was when the observed photons */
/*     departed the target's location.  The vector from the observer to */
/*     this computed target location is called a "light time corrected" */
/*     vector.  The light time correction depends on the motion of the */
/*     target, but it is independent of the velocity of the observer */
/*     relative to the solar system barycenter. Relativistic effects */
/*     such as light bending and gravitational delay are not accounted */
/*     for in the light time correction performed by this routine. */

/*     The velocity of the observer also affects the apparent location */
/*     of a target:  photons arriving at the observer are subject to a */
/*     "raindrop effect" whereby their velocity relative to the observer */
/*     is, using a Newtonian approximation, the photons' velocity */
/*     relative to the solar system barycenter minus the velocity of the */
/*     observer relative to the solar system barycenter.  This effect is */
/*     called "stellar aberration."  Stellar aberration is independent */
/*     of the motion of the target.  The stellar aberration formula used */
/*     by this routine is non- relativistic. */

/*     Stellar aberration corrections are applied after light time */
/*     corrections:  the light time corrected target position vector is */
/*     used as an input to the stellar aberration correction. */

/*     When light time and stellar aberration corrections are both */
/*     applied to a geometric position vector, the resulting position */
/*     vector indicates where the target "appears to be" from the */
/*     observer's location. */

/*     As opposed to computing the apparent position of a target, one */
/*     may wish to compute the pointing direction required for */
/*     transmission of photons to the target.  This requires correction */
/*     of the geometric target position for the effects of light time and */
/*     stellar aberration, but in this case the corrections are computed */
/*     for radiation traveling from the observer to the target. */

/*     The "transmission" light time correction yields the target's */
/*     location as it will be when photons emitted from the observer's */
/*     location at ET arrive at the target.  The transmission stellar */
/*     aberration correction is the inverse of the traditional stellar */
/*     aberration correction:  it indicates the direction in which */
/*     radiation should be emitted so that, using a Newtonian */
/*     approximation, the sum of the velocity of the radiation relative */
/*     to the observer and of the observer's velocity, relative to the */
/*     solar system barycenter, yields a velocity vector that points in */
/*     the direction of the light time corrected position of the target. */

/*     The traditional aberration corrections applicable to observation */
/*     and those applicable to transmission are related in a simple way: */
/*     one may picture the geometry of the "transmission" case by */
/*     imagining the "observation" case running in reverse time order, */
/*     and vice versa. */

/*     One may reasonably object to using the term "observer" in the */
/*     transmission case, in which radiation is emitted from the */
/*     observer's location.  The terminology was retained for */
/*     consistency with earlier documentation. */

/*     Below, we indicate the aberration corrections to use for some */
/*     common applications: */

/*        1) Find the apparent direction of a target for a remote-sensing */
/*           observation. */

/*              Use 'LT+S' or 'CN+S: apply both light time and stellar */
/*              aberration corrections. */

/*           Note that using light time corrections alone ('LT' or 'CN') */
/*           is generally not a good way to obtain an approximation to */
/*           an apparent target vector: since light time and stellar */
/*           aberration corrections often partially cancel each other, */
/*           it may be more accurate to use no correction at all than to */
/*           use light time alone. */


/*        2) Find the corrected pointing direction to radiate a signal */
/*           to a target. This computation is often applicable for */
/*           implementing communications sessions. */

/*              Use 'XLT+S' or 'XCN+S: apply both light time and stellar */
/*              aberration corrections for transmission. */


/*        3) Compute the apparent position of a target body relative */
/*           to a star or other distant object. */

/*              Use 'LT', 'CN', 'LT+S', or 'CN+S' as needed to match the */
/*              correction applied to the position of the distant */
/*              object. For example, if a star position is obtained from */
/*              a catalog, the position vector may not be corrected for */
/*              stellar aberration. In this case, to find the angular */
/*              separation of the star and the limb of a planet, the */
/*              vector from the observer to the planet should be */
/*              corrected for light time but not stellar aberration. */


/*        4) Obtain an uncorrected state vector derived directly from */
/*           data in an SPK file. */

/*              Use 'NONE'. */


/*        5) Use a geometric position vector as a low-accuracy estimate */
/*           of the apparent position for an application where execution */
/*           speed is critical: */

/*              Use 'NONE'. */


/*        6) While this routine cannot perform the relativistic */
/*           aberration corrections required to compute positions */
/*           with the highest possible accuracy, it can supply the */
/*           geometric positions required as inputs to these */
/*           computations: */

/*              Use 'NONE', then apply high-accuracy aberration */
/*              corrections (not available in the SPICE Toolkit). */


/*     Below, we discuss in more detail how the aberration corrections */
/*     applied by this routine are computed. */


/*     Geometric case */
/*     ============== */

/*        SPKAPO begins by computing the geometric position T(ET) of the */
/*        target body relative to the solar system barycenter (SSB). */
/*        Subtracting the geometric position of the observer O(ET) gives */
/*        the geometric position of the target body relative to the */
/*        observer. The one-way light time, LT, is given by */

/*                  | T(ET) - O(ET) | */
/*           LT = ------------------- */
/*                          c */

/*        The geometric relationship between the observer, target, and */
/*        solar system barycenter is as shown: */


/*           SSB ---> O(ET) */
/*            |      / */
/*            |     / */
/*            |    / */
/*            |   /  T(ET) - O(ET) */
/*            V  V */
/*           T(ET) */


/*        The returned position vector is */

/*           T(ET) - O(ET) */


/*     Reception case */
/*     ============== */

/*        When any of the options 'LT', 'CN', 'LT+S', 'CN+S' are */
/*        selected, SPKAPO computes the position of the target body at */
/*        epoch ET-LT, where LT is the one-way light time.  Let T(t) */
/*        and O(t) represent the positions of the target and observer */
/*        relative to the solar system barycenter at time t; then LT */
/*        is the solution of the */
/*        light-time equation */

/*                  | T(ET-LT) - O(ET) | */
/*           LT = ------------------------                            (1) */
/*                           c */

/*        The ratio */

/*            | T(ET) - O(ET) | */
/*          ---------------------                                     (2) */
/*                    c */

/*        is used as a first approximation to LT; inserting (2) into the */
/*        RHS of the light-time equation (1) yields the "one-iteration" */
/*        estimate of the one-way light time. Repeating the process */
/*        until the estimates of LT converge yields the "converged */
/*        Newtonian" light time estimate. */

/*        Subtracting the geometric position of the observer O(ET) gives */
/*        the position of the target body relative to the observer: */
/*        T(ET-LT) - O(ET). */

/*           SSB ---> O(ET) */
/*            | \     | */
/*            |  \    | */
/*            |   \   | T(ET-LT) - O(ET) */
/*            |    \  | */
/*            V     V V */
/*           T(ET)  T(ET-LT) */


/*        The light-time corrected position is the vector */

/*           T(ET-LT) - O(ET) */

/*        If correction for stellar aberration is requested, the target */
/*        position is rotated toward the solar system barycenter-relative */
/*        velocity vector of the observer. The magnitude of the rotation */
/*        depends on the magnitude of the observer's velocity relative */
/*        to the solar system barycenter and the angle between */
/*        this velocity and the observer-target vector.  The rotation */
/*        is computed as follows: */

/*           Let r be the light time corrected vector from the observer */
/*           to the object, and v be the velocity of the observer with */
/*           respect to the solar system barycenter. Let w be the angle */
/*           between them. The aberration angle phi is given by */

/*              sin(phi) = v sin(w) / c */

/*           Let h be the vector given by the cross product */

/*              h = r X v */

/*           Rotate r by phi radians about h to obtain the apparent */
/*           position of the object. */



/*     Transmission case */
/*     ================== */

/*        When any of the options 'XLT', 'XCN', 'XLT+S', 'XCN+S' are */
/*        selected, SPKAPO computes the position of the target body T at */
/*        epoch ET+LT, where LT is the one-way light time.  LT is the */
/*        solution of the light-time equation */

/*                  | T(ET+LT) - O(ET) | */
/*           LT = ------------------------                            (3) */
/*                            c */

/*        Subtracting the geometric position of the observer, O(ET), */
/*        gives the position of the target body relative to the */
/*        observer: T(ET-LT) - O(ET). */

/*                   SSB --> O(ET) */
/*                  / |    * */
/*                 /  |  *  T(ET+LT) - O(ET) */
/*                /   |* */
/*               /   *| */
/*              V  V  V */
/*          T(ET+LT)  T(ET) */


/*        The light-time corrected position is */

/*           T(ET+LT) - O(ET) */

/*        If correction for stellar aberration is requested, the target */
/*        position is rotated away from the solar system barycenter- */
/*        relative velocity vector of the observer.  The magnitude of the */
/*        rotation depends on the magnitude of the velocity and the */
/*        angle between the velocity and the observer-target vector. */
/*        The rotation is computed as in the reception case, but the */
/*        sign of the rotation angle is negated. */

/*     Neither special nor general relativistic effects are accounted */
/*     for in the aberration corrections performed by this routine. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     In the following code fragment, SPKSSB and SPKAPO are used */
/*     to display the position of Io (body 501) as seen from the */
/*     Voyager 2 spacecraft (Body -32) at a series of epochs. */

/*     Normally, one would call the high-level reader SPKPOS to obtain */
/*     position vectors.  The example below illustrates the interface */
/*     of this routine, but is not intended as a recommendation on */
/*     how to use the SPICE SPK subsystem. */

/*     The use of integer ID codes is necessitated by the low-level */
/*     interface of this routine. */

/*        IO    = 501 */
/*        VGR2  = -32 */

/*        DO WHILE ( EPOCH .LE. END ) */

/*           CALL SPKSSB (  VGR2,  EPOCH, 'J2000', STVGR2  ) */
/*           CALL SPKAPO (  IO,    EPOCH, 'J2000', STVGR2, */
/*       .                 'LT+S', STIO,   LT              ) */

/*           CALL RECRAD (  STIO,  RANGE,  RA,     DEC     ) */
/*           WRITE (*,*)  RA * DPR(),  DEC * DPR() */

/*           EPOCH = EPOCH + DELTA */

/*        END DO */

/* $ Restrictions */

/*     1) The ephemeris files to be used by SPKAPO must be loaded */
/*        (normally by the SPICELIB kernel loader FURNSH) before */
/*        this routine is called. */

/*     2) Unlike most other SPK position computation routines, this */
/*        routine requires that the input state be relative to an */
/*        inertial reference frame.  Non-inertial frames are not */
/*        supported by this routine. */

/*     3) In a future version of this routine, the implementation */
/*        of the aberration corrections may be enhanced to improve */
/*        accuracy. */
