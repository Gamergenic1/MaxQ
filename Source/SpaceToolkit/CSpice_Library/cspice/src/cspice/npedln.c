/* $ Detailed_Input */

/*     A, */
/*     B, */
/*     C              are the lengths of the semi-axes of a triaxial */
/*                    ellipsoid which is centered at the origin and */
/*                    oriented so that its axes lie on the x-, y- and */
/*                    z- coordinate axes.  A, B, and C are the lengths of */
/*                    the semi-axes that point in the x, y, and z */
/*                    directions respectively. */

/*     LINEPT */
/*     LINEDR         are, respectively, a point and a direction vector */
/*                    that define a line.  The line is the set of vectors */

/*                       LINEPT   +   t * LINEDR */

/*                    where t is any real number. */

/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*     PNEAR          is the point on the ellipsoid that is closest to */
/*                    the line, if the line doesn't intersect the */
/*                    ellipsoid. */

/*                    If the line intersects the ellipsoid, PNEAR will */
/*                    be a point of intersection.  If LINEPT is outside */
/*                    of the ellipsoid, PNEAR will be the closest point */
/*                    of intersection.  If LINEPT is inside the */
/*                    ellipsoid, PNEAR will not necessarily be the */
/*                    closest point of intersection. */


/*     DIST           is the distance of the line from the ellipsoid. */
/*                    This is the minimum distance between any point on */
/*                    the line and any point on the ellipsoid. */

/*                    If the line intersects the ellipsoid, DIST is zero. */

/* $ Parameters */

/*     UBEL           is the upper bound of the array used to contain */
/*                    a SPICELIB ellipse.  See the ELLIPSES Required */
/*                    Reading for details. */

/*     UBPL           is the upper bound of the array used to contain */
/*                    a SPICELIB plane.  See the PLANES Required Reading */
/*                    for details. */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*     If this routine detects an error, the output arguments NEARP and */
/*     DIST are not modified. */

/*     1)  If the length of any semi-axis of the ellipsoid is */
/*         non-positive, the error SPICE(INVALIDAXISLENGTH) is signalled. */

/*     2)  If the line's direction vector is the zero vector, the error */
/*         SPICE(ZEROVECTOR) is signalled. */

/*     3)  If the length of any semi-axis of the ellipsoid is zero after */
/*         the semi-axis lengths are scaled by the reciprocal of the */
/*         magnitude of the longest semi-axis and then squared, the error */
/*         SPICE(DEGENERATECASE) is signalled. */

/*     4)  If the input ellipsoid is extremely flat or needle-shaped */
/*         and has its shortest axis close to perpendicular to the input */
/*         line, numerical problems could cause this routine's algorithm */
/*         to fail, in which case the error SPICE(DEGENERATECASE) is */
/*         signalled. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     For any ellipsoid and line, if the line does not intersect the */
/*     ellipsoid, there is a unique point on the ellipsoid that is */
/*     closest to the line.  Therefore, the distance DIST between */
/*     ellipsoid and line is well-defined.  The unique line segment of */
/*     length DIST that connects the line and ellipsoid is normal to */
/*     both of these objects at its endpoints. */

/*     If the line intersects the ellipsoid, the distance between the */
/*     line and ellipsoid is zero. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     1)   We can find the distance between an instrument optic axis ray */
/*          and the surface of a body modelled as a tri-axial ellipsoid */
/*          using this routine.  If the instrument position and pointing */
/*          unit vector in body-fixed coordinates are */

/*             LINEPT = ( 1.0D6,  2.0D6,  3.0D6 ) */

/*          and */

/*             LINEDR = ( -4.472091234D-1 */
/*                        -8.944182469D-1, */
/*                        -4.472091234D-3  ) */

/*          and the body semi-axes lengths are */

/*             A = 7.0D5 */
/*             B = 7.0D5 */
/*             C = 6.0D5, */

/*          then the call to NPEDLN */

/*             CALL NPEDLN ( A,      B,      C, */

/*     The algorithm used in this routine has two parts.  The first */
/*     part handles the case where the input line and ellipsoid */
/*     intersect.  Our procedure is simple in that case; we just */
/*     call SURFPT twice, passing it first one ray determined by the */
/*     input line, then a ray pointing in the opposite direction. */
/*     The second part of the algorithm handles the case where SURFPT */
/*     doesn't find an intersection. */

/*     Finding the nearest point on the ellipsoid to the line, when the */
/*     two do not intersect, is a matter of following four steps: */

/*     1)  Find the points on the ellipsoid where the surface normal */
/*         is normal to the line's direction.  This set of points is */
/*         an ellipse centered at the origin.  The point we seek MUST */
/*         lie on this `candidate' ellipse. */

/*     2)  Project the candidate ellipse onto a plane that is normal */
/*         to the line's direction.  This projection preserves */
/*         distance from the line; the nearest point to the line on */
/*         this new ellipse is the projection of the nearest point to */
/*         the line on the candidate ellipse, and these two points are */
/*         exactly the same distance from the line.  If computed using */
/*         infinite-precision arithmetic, this projection would be */
/*         guaranteed to be non-degenerate as long as the input */
/*         ellipsoid were non-degenerate.  This can be verified by */
/*         taking the inner product of the scaled normal to the candidate */
/*         ellipse plane and the line's unitized direction vector */
/*         (these vectors are called NORMAL and UDIR in the code below); */
/*         the inner product is strictly greater than 1 if the ellipsoid */
/*         is non-degenerate. */

/*     3)  The nearest point on the line to the projected ellipse will */
/*         be contained in the plane onto which the projection is done; */
/*         we find this point and then find the nearest point to it on */
/*         the projected ellipse.  The distance between these two points */
/*         is the distance between the line and the ellipsoid. */

/*     4)  Finally, we find the point on the candidate ellipse that was */
/*         projected to the nearest point to the line on the projected */
/*         ellipse that was found in step 3.  This is the nearest point */
/*         on the ellipsoid to the line. */
