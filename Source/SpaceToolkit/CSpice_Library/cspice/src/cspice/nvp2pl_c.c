-Brief_I/O
 
   Variable  I/O  Description 
   --------  ---  -------------------------------------------------- 
   normal, 
   point      I   A normal vector and a point defining a plane. 
   plane      O   A CSPICE plane structure representing the plane. 
 
-Detailed_Input
 
   normal, 
   point 
                  are, respectively, a normal vector and point that 
                  define a plane in three-dimensional space.  normal 
                  need not be a unit vector. Let the symbol < a, b > 
                  indicate the inner product of vectors a and b; 
                  then the geometric plane is the set of vectors x 
                  in three-dimensional space that satisfy 
 
                     < x - point, normal >  =  0. 
 
-Detailed_Output
 
   plane          is a CSPICE plane structure that represents the 
                  geometric plane defined by point and normal. 
 
-Parameters
 
   None. 
 
-Exceptions
 
   1)  If the input vector normal is the zero vector, the error 
       SPICE(ZEROVECTOR) is signaled. 
 
-Files
 
   None. 
 
-Particulars

   CSPICE geometry routines that deal with planes use the `plane' 
   data type to represent input and output planes.  This data type 
   makes the subroutine interfaces simpler and more uniform. 
 
   The CSPICE routines that produce CSPICE planes from data that 
   define a plane are: 
 
      nvc2pl_c ( Normal vector and constant to plane ) 
      nvp2pl_c ( Normal vector and point to plane    ) 
      psv2pl_c ( Point and spanning vectors to plane ) 
 
   The CSPICE routines that convert CSPICE planes to data that 
   define a plane are: 
 
      pl2nvc_c ( Plane to normal vector and constant ) 
      pl2nvp_c ( Plane to normal vector and point    ) 
      pl2psv_c ( Plane to point and spanning vectors ) 
 
   Any of these last three routines may be used to convert this 
   routine's output, plane, to another representation of a 
   geometric plane. 
 
-Examples
 
   1)  Project a vector v orthogonally onto a plane defined by point 
       and normal.  proj is the projection we want; it is the 
       closest vector in the plane to v. 
 
          nvp2pl_c ( normal,  point,   &plane ); 
          vprjp_c  ( v,       &plane,  proj   );
 
 
   2)  Given a point in a plane and a normal vector, find the 
       distance of the plane from the origin.  We make a 
       `plane' from the point and normal, then convert the 
       plane to a unit normal and constant.  The output constant 
       is (according to the specification of pl2nvc_c) the distance of 
       the plane from the origin. 
 
          nvp2pl_c ( normal,  point,  &plane   ); 
          pl2nvc_c ( &plane,  normal, constant );
