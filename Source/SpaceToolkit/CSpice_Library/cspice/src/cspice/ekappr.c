/*     These parameters apply to EK files using architecture 4. */
/*     These files use a paged DAS file as their underlying file */
/*     structure. */

/*     In paged DAS EK files, data pages are structured:  they contain */
/*     metadata as well as data.  The metadata is located in the last */
/*     few addresses of each page, so as to interfere as little as */
/*     possible with calculation of data addresses. */

/*     Each data page belongs to exactly one segment.  Some bookkeeping */
/*     information, such as record pointers, is also stored in data */
/*     pages. */

/*     Each page contains a forward pointer that allows rapid lookup */
/*     of data items that span multiple pages.  Each page also keeps */
/*     track of the current number of links from its parent segment */
/*     to the page.  Link counts enable pages to `know' when they */
/*     are no longer in use by a segment; unused pages are deallocated */
/*     and returned to the free list. */

/*     The parameters in this include file depend on the parameters */
/*     declared in the include file ekpage.inc.  If those parameters */
/*     change, this file must be updated.  The specified parameter */
/*     declarations we need from that file are: */

/*     Include Section:  EK Record Pointer Parameters */

/*        ekrecptr.inc Version 2  18-JUL-1995 (NJB) */


/*     This file declares parameters used in EK record pointers. */
/*     Each segment references data in a given record via two levels */
/*     of indirection:  a record number points to a record pointer, */
/*     which is a structured array of metadata and data pointers. */

/*     Record pointers always occupy contiguous ranges of integer */
/*     addresses. */

/*     The parameter declarations in this file depend on the assumption */
/*     that integer pages contain 256 DAS integer words and that the */
/*     maximum number of columns in a segment is 100.  Record pointers */
/*     are stored in integer data pages, so they must fit within the */
/*     usable data area afforded by these pages.  The size of the usable */
/*     data area is given by the parameter IPSIZE which is declared in */
/*     ekdatpag.inc.  The assumed value of IPSIZE is 254. */


/*     The first element of each record pointer is a status indicator. */
/*     The meanings of status indicators depend on whether the parent EK */
/*     is shadowed or not.  For shadowed EKs, allowed status values and */
/*     their meanings are: */

/*        OLD       The record has not been modified since */
/*                  the EK containing the record was opened. */

/*        UPDATE    The record is an update of a previously existing */
/*                  record.  The original record is now on the */
/*                  modified record list. */

/*        NEW       The record has been added since the EK containing the */
/*                  record was opened.  The record is not an update */
/*                  of a previously existing record. */

/*        DELOLD    This status applies only to a backup record. */
/*                  DELOLD status indicates that the record corresponds */
/*                  to a deleted OLD record in the source segment. */

/*        DELNEW    This status applies only to a backup record. */
/*                  DELNEW status indicates that the record corresponds */
/*                  to a deleted NEW record in the source segment. */

/*        DELUPD    This status applies only to a backup record. */
/*                  DELUPD status indicates that the record corresponds */
/*                  to a deleted UPDATEd record in the source segment. */

/*     In EKs that are not shadowed, all records have status OLD. */



/*     The following parameters refer to indices within the record */
/*     pointer structure: */

/*     Index of status indicator: */


/*     Each record pointer contains a pointer to its companion:  for a */
/*     record belonging to a shadowed EK, this is the backup counterpart, */
/*     or if the parent EK is itself a backup EK, a pointer to the */
/*     record's source record.  The pointer is UNINIT (see below) if the */
/*     record is unmodified. */

/*     Record companion pointers contain record numbers, not record */
/*     base addresses. */

/*     Index of record's companion pointer: */


/*     Each data item is referenced by an integer.  The meaning of */
/*     this integer depends on the representation of data in the */
/*     column to which the data item belongs.  Actual lookup of a */
/*     data item must be done by subroutines appropriate to the class of */
/*     the column to which the item belongs.  Note that data items don't */
/*     necessarily occupy contiguous ranges of DAS addresses. */

/*     Base address of data pointers: */


/*     Maximum record pointer size: */


/*     Data pointers are given the value UNINIT to start with; this */
/*     indicates that the data item is uninitialized.  UNINIT is */
/*     distinct from the value NULL.  NOBACK indicates an uninitialized */
/*     backup column entry. */

/*                    routine.  RECNO is used to identify the record */
/*                    when writing column entries to it. */

/* $ Parameters */

/*     None. */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*     1)  If HANDLE is invalid, the error will be diagnosed by routines */
/*         called by this routine.  The file will not be modified. */

/*     2)  If SEGNO is out of range, the error SPICE(INVALIDINDEX) */
/*         will be signalled.  The file will not be modified. */

/*     3)  If an I/O error occurs while reading or writing the indicated */
/*         file, the error will be diagnosed by routines called by this */
/*         routine.  The file may be corrupted. */

/*     See the EK Required Reading for a discussion of the EK file */
/*     format. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     This routine operates by side effects:  It appends a new, empty */
/*     record structure to an EK segment.  The ordinal position of the */
/*     new record is one greater than the previous number of records in */
/*     in the segment. */

/*     After a new record has been appended to a segment by this routine, */
/*     the record must be populated with data using the EKACEx */
/*     routines.  EKs are valid only when all of their column entries */
/*     are initialized. */

/*     To insert a record into a segment at a specified ordinal position, */
/*     use the routine EKAPPR. */

/*     This routine cannot be used with the "fast write" suite of */
/*     routines.  See the EK Required Reading for a discussion of the */
/*     fast writers. */

/*     When a record is inserted into an EK file that is not shadowed, */
/*     the status of the record starts out set to OLD.  The status */
/*     does not change when data is added to the record. */

/*     If the target EK is shadowed, the new record will be given the */
/*     status NEW.  Updating column values in the record does not change */
/*     its status.  When changes are committed, the status is set to OLD. */
/*     If a rollback is performed before changes are committed, the */
/*     record is deleted.  Closing the target file without committing */
/*     changes implies a rollback. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     1)  Append a record to a specified segment. */

/*         Suppose we have an E-kernel named ORDER_DB.EK which contains */
/*         records of orders for data products.  The E-kernel has a */
/*         table called DATAORDERS that consists of the set of columns */
/*         listed below: */

/*            DATAORDERS */

/*               Column Name     Data Type */
/*               -----------     --------- */
/*               ORDER_ID        INTEGER */
/*               CUSTOMER_ID     INTEGER */
/*               LAST_NAME       CHARACTER*(*) */
/*               FIRST_NAME      CHARACTER*(*) */
/*               ORDER_DATE      TIME */
/*               COST            DOUBLE PRECISION */

/*         The order database also has a table of items that have been */
/*         ordered.  The columns of this table are shown below: */

/*            DATAITEMS */

/*               Column Name     Data Type */
/*               -----------     --------- */
/*               ITEM_ID         INTEGER */
/*               ORDER_ID        INTEGER */
/*               ITEM_NAME       CHARACTER*(*) */
/*               DESCRIPTION     CHARACTER*(*) */
/*               PRICE           DOUBLE PRECISION */


/*         We'll suppose that the file ORDER_DB.EK contains two segments, */
/*         the first containing the DATAORDERS table and the second */
/*         containing the DATAITEMS table. */

/*         If we wanted to insert a new record into the DATAORDERS */
/*         table in position 1, we'd make the following calls: */

/*            C */
/*            C     Open the database for write access.  This call is */
/*            C     made when the file already exists.  See EKOPN for */
/*            C     an example of creating a new file. */
/*            C */
/*                  CALL EKOPW ( 'ORDER_DB.EK', HANDLE ) */

/*            C */
/*            C     Append a new, empty record to the DATAORDERS */
/*            C     table. Recall that the DATAORDERS table */
/*            C     is in segment number 1.  The call will return */
/*            C     the number of the new, empty record. */
/*            C */
/*                  CALL EKAPPR ( HANDLE, 1, RECNO ) */

/*            C */
/*            C     At this point, the new record is empty.  A valid EK */
/*            C     cannot contain empty records.  We fill in the data */
/*            C     here.  Data items are filled in one column at a time. */
/*            C     The order in which the columns are filled in is not */
/*            C     important.  We use the EKACEx (add column entry) */
/*            C     routines to fill in column entries.  We'll assume */
/*            C     that no entries are null.  All entries are scalar, */
/*            C     so the entry size is 1. */
/*            C */
