/*      VARIABLE  I/O  DESCRIPTION */
/*      --------  ---  -------------------------------------------------- */

/*      The function returns the value, .TRUE., if and only if SPICELIB */
/*      routines should return immediately upon entry. */

/* $ Detailed_Input */

/*      None. */

/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*      The function returns the value, .TRUE., if and only if SPICELIB */
/*      routines should return immediately upon entry.  The criterion */
/*      for this is that the error response action is set to */
/*      'RETURN', and an error condition exists. */

/* $ Parameters */

/*     None. */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*      This routine does not detect any errors. */

/*      However, this routine is part of the SPICELIB error */
/*      handling mechanism. */

/* $ Files */

/*      None. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*      Please read the "required reading" first! */

/*      This routine can be referenced in non-toolkit code; in */
/*      fact, its use is encouraged.  Its purpose is to signal */
/*      to the routine calling it that the caller should */
/*      return immediately.  The reference to RETURN should */
/*      be the first executable line of the calling program. */

/*      In 'RETURN' mode, SPICELIB routines */
/*      that have external references, or that can */
/*      detect errors, return immediately upon entry when an */
/*      error condition exists.  They use RETURN to determine */
/*      when these conditions are met.  Non--toolkit routines */
/*      can do the same. */

/*      Additionally, when an error is signaled in 'RETURN' mode, */
/*      no further errors can be signaled until the error condition */
/*      is reset by a call to RESET.  Calls to SIGERR simply have */
/*      no effect.  Therefore, the error messages set in response */
/*      to the FIRST error that was detected will be saved until */
/*      RESET is called.  These messages can be retrieved by */
/*      calls to GETMSG. */

/*      There are a number of advantages to using this mechanism. */
/*      First, the likelihood of an error resulting in crash */
/*      in a different routine is greatly reduced.  Second, */
/*      a program does not have to test the error status */
/*      (using a reference to FAILED) after each call to a toolkit */
/*      routine, but rather can make one test of status at the end */
/*      of a series of calls.  See "Examples" below. */

/*      See the subroutine ERRACT for definitions of the error action */
/*      codes. */

/* $ Examples */

/*      1.  In this example, we show how to place a reference */
/*          to RETURN in your code: */

/*          C */
/*          C     No executable lines precede this one. */
/*          C */
/*          C     Test whether to return before doing */
/*          C     anything else. */
/*          C */

/*                IF ( RETURN() )  RETURN */


/*                [ rest of code goes here] */

/*                          . */
/*                          . */
/*                          . */


/*      2.  Here's how one might code a sequence of calls */
/*          to routines with code that follows the pattern */
/*          given in example #1 above: */

/*                         . */
/*                         . */
/*                         . */

/*                [ code may go here ] */

/*          C */
/*          C     We call routines A, B, and C;  then we */
/*          C     test for errors, using the SPICELIB error */
/*          C     status indicator, FAILED: */
/*          C */

/*                CALL  A */
/*                CALL  B */
/*                CALL  C */

/*                IF ( FAILED() ) THEN */

/*          C */
/*          C        If we're here, an error occurred.  The */
/*          C        error might have been detected by A, B, C, */
/*          C        or by a routine called by one of them. */
/*          C        Get the explanation of the short error message */
/*          C        and output it using the routine, USER_OUT */
/*          C        [USER_OUT is a fictitious routine]: */
/*          C */

/*                   CALL GETMSG ( 'EXPLAIN', MSG ) */

/*                   CALL USER_OUT ( MSG ) */

/*                END IF */

/*                [ rest of code goes here ] */

/*                           . */
/*                           . */
/*                           . */
