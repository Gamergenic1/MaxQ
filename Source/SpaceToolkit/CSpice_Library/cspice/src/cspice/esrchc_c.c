-Procedure esrchc_c ( Equivalence search, character )

-Abstract
 
   Search for a given value within a character string array. 
   Return the index of the first equivalent array entry, or -1 
   if no equivalent element is found.

-Brief_I/O
 
   VARIABLE  I/O              DESCRIPTION 
   --------  ---  -------------------------------------------------- 
   value      I   Key value to be found in array. 
   ndim       I   Dimension of array. 
   lenvals    I   String length.
   array      I   Character string array to search. 
 
   The function returns the index of the first array entry 
   equivalent to value, or -1 if none is found. 
 
-Detailed_Input
 
   value       is the key value to be found in the array.  Trailing
               blanks in this key are not significant:  string matches
               found by this routine do not require trailing blanks in
               value to match those in the corresponding element of
               array.

   ndim        is the dimension of the array. 

   lenvals     is the declared length of the strings in the input
               string array, including null terminators.  The input   
               array should be declared with dimension 

                  [ndim][lenvals]
 
   array       is the array of character srings to be searched.  Trailing
               blanks in the strings in this array are not significant.   
 
-Detailed_Output
 
   The function returns the index of the first element of the 
   input array equivalent to the input value, or -1 if the 
   array contains no such elements. 
 
   Two strings are equivalent if they contain the same characters 
   in the same order, when blanks are ignored and uppercase and 
   lowercase characters are considered equal. 
 
-Parameters
 
   None. 
 
-Exceptions
 
   1) If ndim < 1 the function value is -1.  This is not considered
      an error.

   2) If input key value pointer is null, the error SPICE(NULLPOINTER) will 
      be signaled.  The function returns -1.
  
   3) The input key value may have length zero.  This case is not
      considered an error.

   4) If the input array pointer is null,  the error SPICE(NULLPOINTER) will 
      be signaled.  The function returns -1.

   5) If the input array string's length is less than 2, the error
      SPICE(STRINGTOOSHORT) will be signaled.  The function returns -1.
 
-Files
 
   None. 
 
-Particulars
 
   esrchc_c is identical to isrchc_c, except that it looks for 
   the first equivalent string (as defined by eqstr_c) instead 
   of the first identical one. 
 
-Examples
 
   Let array be declared with dimension

      [NDIM][STRLEN]

   and contain the following elements: 
 
      array[0] == "This" 
      array[1] == "little" 
      array[2] == "piggy" 
      array[3] == "went" 
      array[4] == "to" 
      array[5] == "market" 
 
   Then 
 
      esrchc_c ( "PIGGY",      NDIM,  STRLEN,  array )  ==  2
      esrchc_c ( " LiTtLe  ",  NDIM,  STRLEN,  array )  ==  1 
      esrchc_c ( "W e n t",    NDIM,  STRLEN,  array )  ==  3 
      esrchc_c ( "mall",       NDIM,  STRLEN,  array )  == -1
