/*     Within the EK system, data types of EK column contents are */
/*     represented by integer codes.  The codes and their meanings */
/*     are listed below. */

/*     Integer codes are also used within the DAS system to indicate */
/*     data types; the EK system makes no assumptions about compatibility */
/*     between the codes used here and those used in the DAS system. */


/*     Character type: */


/*     Double precision type: */


/*     Integer type: */


/*     `Time' type: */

/*     Within the EK system, time values are represented as ephemeris */
/*     seconds past J2000 (TDB), and double precision numbers are used */
/*     to store these values.  However, since time values require special */
/*     treatment both on input and output, and since the `TIME' column */
/*     has a special role in the EK specification and code, time values */
/*     are identified as a type distinct from double precision numbers. */

/*     NODE       I   Node number. */

/*     The function returns the DAS integer base address of the */
/*     specified node. */

/* $ Detailed_Input */

/*     NODE           is the number of a node in an EK tree. */

/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*     The function returns the DAS integer base address of the */
/*     specified node.  This address is the predecessor of the first */
/*     DAS integer word occupied by the node. */

/* $ Parameters */

/*     None. */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*     1)  No error checking is done on the input node number. */

/* $ Files */

/*     See the EK Required Reading for a discussion of the EK file */
/*     format. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     This routine is a utility that allows callers to locate a node */
/*     of a tree in the DAS integer address space.  Most commonly, this */
/*     routine is used to locate the root of a tree. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     See EKNSEG. */
