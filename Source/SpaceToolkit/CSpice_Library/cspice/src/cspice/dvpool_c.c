-Brief_I/O
 
   VARIABLE  I/O  DESCRIPTION 
   --------  ---  -------------------------------------------------- 
   name       I   Name of the kernel variable to be deleted. 
 
-Detailed_Input
 
   name       is the name of the kernel pool variable to delete. 
              The name and associated values are removed from the 
              kernel pool, freeing the occupied space. 
 
              If watches are set on the variable designated by 
              name, the corresponding agents are placed on the list 
              of agents to be notified of a kernel variable update. 
 
-Detailed_Output
 
   None. 
 
-Parameters
 
   None. 
 
-Exceptions
 
   1) If the specified variable is not present in the kernel pool, 
      this routine simply returns.  No error is signaled. 
 
   2) If the input string pointer is null, the error SPICE(NULLPOINTER) 
      will be signaled.

   3) If the input name does not contain at least 1 character, the 
      error SPICE(EMPTYSTRING) will be signaled.
   
-Files
 
   None. 
 
-Particulars
 
   This routine enables users to selectively remove variables from 
   the kernel pool, as opposed to having to clear the pool and 
   reload it. 
 
   Note that it is not necessary to remove kernel variables in order 
   to simply update them; this routine should be used only when 
   variables are to be removed. 
 
-Examples
 
   1) Remove triaxial radii of Jupiter from the kernel pool.
