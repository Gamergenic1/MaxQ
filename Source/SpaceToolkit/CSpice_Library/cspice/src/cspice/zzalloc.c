   E.D. Wright (JPL)

-Version

   CSPICE 1.3.0 26-AUG-2016 (EDW)

      Added routine alloc_SpiceBoolean_C_array.

   CSPICE 1.2.0 02-MAY-2008 (EDW)

      Implemented use of enums as input flags to zzalloc_count.
      Added a routine alloc_count function as an accessor to
      the allocation count stored in zzalloc_count.

   CSPICE 1.1.0 10-MAY-2007 (EDW)

      Added additional error checks on 'row' and 'cols' arguments in
      alloc_SpiceInt_C_array and alloc_SpiceDouble_C_array.

   CSPICE 1.0.10 10-MAY-2007 (EDW)

      Minor edits to clarify declarations and remove unneeded casts.

   Icy 1.0.9 23-JUN-2005 (EDW)

      Added alloc_SpiceString_Pointer_array routine to allocate
      an array of pointers to SpiceChars - a more conventional
      manner to define an array of strings.

      Edited alloc_SpiceMemory to pass an unsigned int rather than
      an int. Added error check for 'op' value in zzalloc_count.
      Cast zzalloc_count calls to void when ignoring the return value.

      Defined NO_NEW_ALLOC preprocessor flag to prevent the memory
      test malloc/free macros from redefining the calls to C malloc/free
      in this routine. Implement the malloc/free macros with:

         #ifndef NO_NEW_ALLOC

         #define malloc(x) alloc_SpiceMemory(x)
         #define free(x)   free_SpiceMemory(x)

         #endif

      placed as the first directives in SpiceUsr.h.

   Icy 1.0.7 13-JUL-2004 (EDW)

      Added proper header documentation.

-Procedure zzalloc_count ( Track number of allocations/deallocations)

-Abstract

   The count increments when allocating memory, the count
   decrements when deallocating memory. The routine can also
   return the current allocation count.

   1) If the input number of strings has value less than 1, the error
      SPICE(NOTPOSITIVE) signals.

   2) If the length of each string has value less than 2 (one character plus
      a line terminator), the error SPICE(STRINGTOOSMALL) signals.

   3) If a malloc fails, the error SPICE(MALLOCFAILED) signals.

-Files

   None.

-Particulars

   This routine produces a memory block functionally similar to a
   declaration of:

      SpiceChar    X[string_count][string_length]

-Examples

   CSPICE wrappers using arrays of strings declare the arrays as:

      SpiceChar         ** cvals;

   Allocate memory:

      cvals = alloc_SpiceString_C_array ( cvals_len, cvals_size );

   Where 'cvals_len' represents the length of each string, 'cvals[i]',
   and 'cvals_size' represents the number of strings in array 'cvals'.

   Use of the allocated array by the gcpool_c routine:

      SpiceInt              start;
      SpiceInt              cvals_size;
      SpiceInt              cvals_len;
      SpiceInt              cvals_dim;
      SpiceBoolean        * found;

      gcpool_c( name, start, cvals_size, cvals_len, &cvals_dim, *cvals, found);
