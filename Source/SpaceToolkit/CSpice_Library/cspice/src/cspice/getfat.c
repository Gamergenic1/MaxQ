/*      VARIABLE  I/O  DESCRIPTION */
/*      --------  ---  -------------------------------------------------- */
/*      FILE       I   The name of a file to be examined. */
/*      ARCH       O   The architecture of the kernel file. */
/*      KERTYP     O   The type of the kernel file. */

/* $ Detailed_Input */

/*     FILE        is the name of a SPICE kernel file whose architecture */
/*                 and type are desired. */

/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*     ARCH        is the file architecture of the SPICE kernel file */
/*                 specified be FILE. If the architecture cannot be */
/*                 determined or is not recognized the value '?' is */
/*                 returned. */

/*                 Architectures currently recognized are: */

/*                    DAF - The file is based on the DAF architecture. */
/*                    DAS - The file is based on the DAS architecture. */
/*                    XFR - The file is in a SPICE transfer file format. */
/*                    DEC - The file is an old SPICE decimal text file. */
/*                    ASC -- An ASCII text file. */
/*                    KPL -- Kernel Pool File (i.e., a text kernel) */
/*                    TXT -- An ASCII text file. */
/*                    TE1 -- Text E-Kernel type 1. */
/*                     ?  - The architecture could not be determined. */

/*                 This variable must be at least 3 characters long. */

/*     KERTYP      is the type of the SPICE kernel file. If the type */
/*                 can not be determined the value '?' is returned. */

/*                 Kernel file types may be any sequence of at most four */
/*                 printing characters. NAIF has reserved for its use */
/*                 types which contain all upper case letters. */

/*                 A file type of 'PRE' means that the file is a */
/*                 pre-release file. */

/*                 This variable may be at most 4 characters long. */

/* $ Parameters */

/*     RECL        is the record length of a binary kernel file. Each */
/*                 record must be large enough to hold 128 double */
/*                 precision numbers. The units in which the record */
/*                 length must be specified vary from environment to */
/*                 environment. For example, VAX Fortran requires */
/*                 record lengths to be specified in longwords, */
/*                 where two longwords equal one double precision */
/*                 number. */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*      1) If the filename specified is blank, then the error */
/*         SPICE(BLANKFILENAME) is signaled. */

/*      2) If any inquire on the filename specified by FILE fails for */
/*         some reason, the error SPICE(INQUIREERROR) is signaled. */

/*      3) If the file specified by FILE does not exist, the error */
/*         SPICE(FILENOTFOUND) is signaled. */

/*      4) If the file specified by FILE is already open but not through */
/*         SPICE interfaces, the error SPICE(EXTERNALOPEN) is signaled. */

/*      5) If an attempt to open the file specified by FILE fails when */
/*         this routine requires that it succeed, the error */
/*         SPICE(FILEOPENFAILED) is signaled. */

/*      6) If an attempt to read the file specified by FILE fails when */
/*         this routine requires that it succeed, the error */
/*         SPICE(FILEREADFAILED) is signaled. */

/*      7) Routines in the call tree of this routine may trap and */
/*         signal errors. */

/*      8) If the ID word in a DAF based kernel is NAIF/DAF, then the */
/*         algorithm GETFAT uses to distinguish between CK and SPK */
/*         kernels may result in an indeterminate KERTYP if the SPK or */
/*         CK files have invalid first segments. */

/* $ Files */

/*     The SPICE kernel file specified by FILE is examined by this */
/*     routine to determine its architecture and type.  If the file */
/*     named by FILE is not connected to a logical unit or loaded */
/*     in the handle manager, this routine will OPEN and CLOSE it. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     This subroutine is a support utility routine that determines the */
/*     architecture and type of a SPICE kernel file. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     Suppose you wish to write a single routine for loading binary */
/*     kernels. You can use this routine to determine the type of the */
/*     file and  then pass the file to the appropriate low level file */
/*     loader to handle the actual loading of the file. */

/*        CALL GETFAT ( FILE, ARCH, KERTYP ) */

/*        IF ( KERTYP .EQ. 'SPK' ) THEN */

/*           CALL SPKLEF ( FILE, HANDLE ) */

/*        ELSE IF ( KERTYP .EQ. 'CK' ) THEN */

/*           CALL CKLPF ( FILE, HANDLE ) */

/*        ELSE IF ( KERTYP .EQ. 'EK' ) THEN */

/*           CALL EKLEF ( FILE, HANDLE ) */

/*        ELSE */

/*           WRITE (*,*) 'The file could not be identified as a known' */
/*           WRITE (*,*) 'kernel type.  Did you load the wrong file' */
/*           WRITE (*,*) 'by mistake?' */

/*        END IF */


/* $ Restrictions */

/*     1) In order to properly determine the type of DAF based binary */
/*        kernels, the routine requires that their first segments and */
/*        the meta data necessary to address them are valid. */
