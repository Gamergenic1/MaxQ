/*     Note:  The column descriptor size parameter CDSCSZ  is */
/*     declared separately in the include section CDSIZE$INC.FOR. */

/*     Offset of column descriptors, relative to start of segment */
/*     integer address range.  This number, when added to the last */
/*     integer address preceding the segment, yields the DAS integer */
/*     base address of the first column descriptor.  Currently, this */
/*     offset is exactly the size of a segment descriptor.  The */
/*     parameter SDSCSZ, which defines the size of a segment descriptor, */
/*     is declared in the include file eksegdsc.inc. */


/*     Size of column descriptor */


/*     Indices of various pieces of column descriptors: */


/*     CLSIDX is the index of the column's class code.  (We use the */
/*     word `class' to distinguish this item from the column's data */
/*     type.) */


/*     TYPIDX is the index of the column's data type code (CHR, INT, DP, */
/*     or TIME).  The type is actually implied by the class, but it */
/*     will frequently be convenient to look up the type directly. */



/*     LENIDX is the index of the column's string length value, if the */
/*     column has character type.  A value of IFALSE in this element of */
/*     the descriptor indicates that the strings have variable length. */


/*     SIZIDX is the index of the column's element size value.  This */
/*     descriptor element is meaningful for columns with fixed-size */
/*     entries.  For variable-sized columns, this value is IFALSE. */


/*     NAMIDX is the index of the base address of the column's name. */


/*     IXTIDX is the data type of the column's index.  IXTIDX */
/*     contains a type value only if the column is indexed. For columns */
/*     that are not indexed, the location IXTIDX contains the boolean */
/*     value IFALSE. */


/*     IXPIDX is a pointer to the column's index.  IXTPDX contains a */
/*     meaningful value only if the column is indexed.  The */
/*     interpretation of the pointer depends on the data type of the */
/*     index. */


/*     NFLIDX is the index of a flag indicating whether nulls are */
/*     permitted in the column.  The value at location NFLIDX is */
/*     ITRUE if nulls are permitted and IFALSE otherwise. */


/*     ORDIDX is the index of the column's ordinal position in the */
/*     list of columns belonging to the column's parent segment. */


/*     METIDX is the index of the column's integer metadata pointer. */
/*     This pointer is a DAS integer address. */


/*     The last position in the column descriptor is reserved.  No */
/*     parameter is defined to point to this location. */

/*     HANDLE         is the handle of an EK file open for write access. */
/*                    A new type 2 segment is to be created in this file */
/*                    via a fast load.  The segment's metadata has */
/*                    already been set up by EKBSEG. */

/*     SEGNO          is the number of the segment to prepare for a */
/*                    fast load. */

/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*     None.  See $Particulars for a description of the effect of this */
/*     routine. */

/* $ Parameters */

/*     None. */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*     1)  If HANDLE is invalid, the error will be diagnosed by routines */
/*         called by this routine. */

/*     2)  If an I/O error occurs while reading or writing the indicated */
/*         file, the error will be diagnosed by routines called by this */
/*         routine. */

/*     See the EK Required Reading for a discussion of the EK file */
/*     format. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     This routine carries out the type-2-specific preparation for */
/*     populating a type 2 EK segment with data via the fast column */
/*     loader routines.  This routine expects the segment's metadata to */
/*     already have been written by EKBSEG. */

/*     This routine expects the segment to contain columns having class */
/*     7, 8, or 9. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     See EKIFLD. */

/* $ Restrictions */

/*     1)  Assumes total number of words required for column metadata */
/*         is no greater than IPSIZE.  Currently, with a maximum of 100 */
/*         columns and a maximum metadata size of 2 words per column, */
/*         this condition is met. */
