-Brief_I/O
 
   Variable  I/O  Description 
   --------  ---  -------------------------------------------------- 
   pck        I   Name of PCK file. 
   ids       I/O  Set of frame class ID codes of frames in PCK file. 
 
-Detailed_Input
 
   pck            is the name of a binary PCK file.
 
   ids            is an initialized CSPICE set data structure. `ids'
                  optionally may contain a set of ID codes on input; on
                  output, the data already present in `ids' will be
                  combined with ID code set found for the file PCK.
 
                  If `ids' contains no data on input, its size and
                  cardinality still must be initialized.
 
-Detailed_Output
 
   ids            is a CSPICE set data structure which contains the
                  union of its contents upon input with the set of
                  reference frame class ID codes of each frame for
                  which data are present in the indicated PCK file. The
                  elements of CSPICE sets are unique; hence each ID
                  code in `ids' appears only once, even if the PCK file
                  contains multiple segments for that ID code.
 
                  See the Examples section below for a complete example
                  program showing how to retrieve the ID codes from
                  `ids'.
                                     
-Parameters
 
   None. 
 
-Exceptions
 
   1)  If the input file has transfer format, the error  
       SPICE(INVALIDFORMAT) is signaled. 
 
   2)  If the input file is not a transfer file but has architecture 
       other than DAF, the error SPICE(BADARCHTYPE) is signaled. 
 
   3)  If the input file is a binary DAF file of type other than 
       PCK, the error SPICE(BADFILETYPE) is signaled. 
 
   4)  If the PCK file cannot be opened or read, the error will 
       be diagnosed by routines called by this routine. 
 
   5)  If the size of the output set argument `ids' is insufficient to 
       contain the actual number of ID codes of frames covered by 
       the indicated PCK file, the error will be diagnosed by 
       routines called by this routine. 
 
   6)  The error SPICE(EMPTYSTRING) is signaled if the input string
       `pck' does not contain at least one character, since the input
       string cannot be converted to a Fortran-style string in this
       case.
 
   7)  The error SPICE(NULLPOINTER) is signaled if the input string
       pointer `pck' is null.

-Files
 
   None. 
 
-Particulars
 
   This routine provides an API via which applications can determine 
   the set of reference frames for which there are data in a 
   specified PCK file. 
 
-Examples
 
   1)  Display the coverage for each frame in a specified PCK file. 
       Find the set of frames in the file.  Loop over the contents 
       of the ID code set:  find the coverage for each item in the 
       set and display the coverage.
