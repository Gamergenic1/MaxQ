/*     --------  ---  -------------------------------------------------- */
/*     PRMPT      I   The prompt to use when asking for input. */
/*     STRING     O   The response typed by a user. */

/* $ Detailed_Input */

/*     PRMPT      is a character string that will be displayed from the */
/*                current cursor position and describes the input that */
/*                the user is expected to enter.  The string PRMPT should */
/*                be relatively short, i.e., 50 or fewer characters, so */
/*                that a response may be typed on the line where the */
/*                prompt appears. */

/*                All characters (including trailing blanks) in PRMPT */
/*                are considered significant and will be displayed. */

/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*     STRING     is a character string that contains the string */
/*                entered by the user. */

/* $ Parameters */

/*     None. */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*     This subroutine uses discovery check-in so that it may be called */
/*     after an error has occurred. */

/*     1) If the attempt to write the prompt to the standard output */
/*        device fails, returning an IOSTAT value not equal to zero, the */
/*        error SPICE(WRITEFAILED) will be signalled. */

/*     2) If the attempt to read the response from the standard input */
/*        device fails, returning an IOSTAT value not equal to zero, the */
/*        error SPICE(READFAILED) will be signalled. */

/* $ Files */

/*     None. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     This is a utility that allows you to "easily" request information */
/*     from a program user.  At a high level, it frees you from the */
/*     peculiarities of a particular implementation of FORTRAN cursor */
/*     control. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     Suppose you wanted to ask a user to input an answer to */
/*     a question such as "Do you want to try again? (Y/N) " */
/*     and leave the cursor at the end of the question as shown here: */

/*        Do you want to try again? (Y/N) _ */

/*     (The underscore indicates the cursor position). */

/*     The following line of code will do what you want. */

/*        CALL PROMPT ( 'Do you want to try again? (Y/N) ', ANSWER ) */

/* $ Restrictions */

/*     This routine is environment specific.  Standard FORTRAN does not */
/*     provide for user control of cursor position after write */
/*     statements. */
