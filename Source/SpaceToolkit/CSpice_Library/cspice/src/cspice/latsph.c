/* $ Particulars */

/*     This routine returns the spherical coordinates of a point */
/*     whose position is input in latitudinal coordinates. */

/*     Latitudinal coordinates are defined by a distance from a central */
/*     reference point, an angle from a reference meridian, and an angle */
/*     above the equator of a sphere centered at the central reference */
/*     point. */

/*     Spherical coordinates are defined by a distance from a central */
/*     reference point, an angle from a reference meridian, and an angle */
/*     from the z-axis. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     Co-latitude is obtained by subtracting latitude from HALFPI() */
/*     Radius and longitude mean the same thing in both latitudinal */
/*     and spherical coordinates.  The table below lists LAT */
/*     corresponding COLAT in terms of degrees. */
