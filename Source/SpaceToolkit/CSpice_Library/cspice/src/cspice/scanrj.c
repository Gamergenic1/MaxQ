/* $ Detailed_Input */

/*     IDS       is a list of the identity codes that we will want to */

/*     N         is the number of different cases. */

/*     NTOKNS    is the number of tokens to consider. */

/*     IDENT     holds the identities of each token that is up for */
/*               consideration. */

/*     BEG       holds the beginning indices of each token being */

/*     some set. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     Suppose you wished to scan a string to locate the beginning and */
/*     endings of words together with punctuation, but that you did not */
/*     want to keep white space. The following code fragment illustrates */
/*     how you could use this routine to accomplish this task. */

/*     Words will be delimited by spaces, periods, commas, colons, */
/*     question marks, exclamation marks, semicolons, parentheses, */
/*     m-dashes, and quotes. */
