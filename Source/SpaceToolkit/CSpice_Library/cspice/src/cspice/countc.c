/*     BLINE      I   Beginning line number. */
/*     ELINE      I   Ending line number. */
/*     LINE      I,O  Workspace. */

/*     COUNTC returns the number of characters. */

/* $ Detailed_Input */

/*     UNIT        is a logical unit that has been connected to a */
/*                 text file by the calling program.  Use the routine */
/*                 TXTOPR to open the file for read access and get its */
/*                 logical unit.  A text file is a formatted, */
/*                 sequential file that contains only printable */
/*                 characters:  ASCII 32-126. */

/*     BLINE, */
/*     ELINE       are line numbers in the text file.  BLINE is */
/*                 the line where the count will begin, and ELINE */
/*                 is the line where the count will end.  The */
/*                 number of characters in the beginning and ending */
/*                 lines are included in the total count. */

/*                 By convention, line 1 is the first line of the file. */

/*     LINE        on input, is an arbitrary character string whose */
/*                 contents are ignored. LINE is used to read lines */
/*                 from the file connected to UNIT; its function */
/*                 is to determine the maximum length of the lines */
/*                 that can be read from the file. Lines longer */
/*                 than the declared length of LINE are truncated */
/*                 as they are read. */

/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*      LINE       on output, is undefined. */

/*     The function, COUNTC,  returns the number of characters in the */
/*     group of lines in the file beginning with BLINE and ending with */
/*     ELINE.  Trailing blanks on a line are not included in the count. */

/* $ Parameters */

/*      None. */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*      1) If an error occurs while reading from the input file, */
/*         the error SPICE(FILEREADFAILED) is signalled. */

/*      2) If a non-printing ASCII character is encountered during */
/*         the count, the error SPICE(INVALIDTEXT) is signalled. */

/*      3) If BLINE is greater than ELINE or if the file does not */
/*         contain both of this lines, the error SPICE(CANNOTFINDGRP) */
/*         is signalled. */

/* $ Files */

/*     See argument UNIT.  COUNTC rewinds the text file connected to */
/*     UNIT and then steps through the file.  The next read statement */
/*     after calling COUNTC would return the line after ELINE. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     This routine counts characters in a group of lines in a text */
/*     file.  Using COUNTC, you can determine in advance how much space */
/*     is required to store those characters. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     The following code fragment opens an existing text file for */
/*     read access and counts the characters that it contains in */
/*     the first five lines.  We'll assume that the longest line */
/*     in the file is 80 characters. */

/*        INTEGER               COUNTC */
/*        INTEGER               UNIT */
/*        INTEGER               N */
/*        CHARACTER*(80)        LINE */

/*        CALL TXTOPR ( 'DATA.TXT', UNIT ) */

/*        N = COUNTC ( UNIT, 1, 5, LINE ) */
