/*     Include Section:  EK Tree Parameters */

/*        ektree.inc  Version 3    22-OCT-1995 (NJB) */


/*     The parameters in this file define the tree structure */
/*     used by the EK system.  This structure is a variant of the */
/*     B*-tree structure described in Knuth's book, that is */

/*         Knuth, Donald E.  "The Art of Computer Programming, */
/*         Volume 3/Sorting and Searching" 1973, pp 471-479. */

/*     The trees used in the EK system differ from generic B*-trees */
/*     primarily in the way keys are treated.  Rather than storing */
/*     unique primary key values in each node, EK trees store integer */
/*     counts that represent the ordinal position of each data value, */
/*     counting from the lowest indexed element in the subtree whose */
/*     root is the node in question.  Thus the keys are unique within */
/*     a node but not across multiple nodes:  in fact the Nth key in */
/*     every leaf node is N.  The absolute ordinal position of a data */
/*     item is defined recursively as the sum of the key of the data item */
/*     and the absolute ordinal position of the data item in the parent */
/*     node that immediately precedes all elements of the node in */
/*     question.  This data structure allows EK trees to support lookup */
/*     of data items based on their ordinal position in a data set.  The */
/*     two prime applications of this capability in the EK system are: */

/*        1) Using trees to index the records in a table, allowing */
/*           the Nth record to be located efficiently. */

/*        2) Using trees to implement order vectors that can be */
/*           maintained when insertions and deletions are done. */
