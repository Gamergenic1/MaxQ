/*     These parameters apply to EK files using architecture 4. */
/*     These files use a paged DAS file as their underlying file */
/*     structure. */

/*     In paged DAS EK files, data pages are structured:  they contain */
/*     metadata as well as data.  The metadata is located in the last */
/*     few addresses of each page, so as to interfere as little as */
/*     possible with calculation of data addresses. */

/*     Each data page belongs to exactly one segment.  Some bookkeeping */
/*     information, such as record pointers, is also stored in data */
/*     pages. */

/*     Each page contains a forward pointer that allows rapid lookup */
/*     of data items that span multiple pages.  Each page also keeps */
/*     track of the current number of links from its parent segment */
/*     to the page.  Link counts enable pages to `know' when they */
/*     are no longer in use by a segment; unused pages are deallocated */
/*     and returned to the free list. */

/*     The parameters in this include file depend on the parameters */
/*     declared in the include file ekpage.inc.  If those parameters */
/*     change, this file must be updated.  The specified parameter */
/*     declarations we need from that file are: */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     This routine operates by side effects:  it deletes an EK data */
/*     page from a specified segment.  The segment's metadata is updated */
/*     to reflect deletion of the page.  If the deleted page is the last */
/*     one of its type in use in the specified segment, the last word in */
/*     use of that type is set to the maximum value.  This prevents */
/*     further attempts to write to the page. */

/*     The changes made by this routine to the target EK file become */
/*     permanent when the file is closed.  Failure to close the file */
/*     properly will leave it in an indeterminate state. */
