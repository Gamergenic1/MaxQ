/*     this routine. */

/* $ Parameters */

/*      None. */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*     1)   If N, the number of data items, is not positive, the error */

/*     2)   If an error occurs while writing to the text file attached */
/*          to unit UNIT, the error SPICE(FILEWRITEFAILED) will be */
/*          signalled. */

/*     3)   If the Fortran logical unit UNIT is not defined, the results */
/*          of this routine are unpredictable. */

/* $ Files */

/*     See the description of UNIT in the Detailed_Input section. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     This routine will encode and write the first N contiguous */
/*     characters contained in the data buffer array DATA. The */
/*     encoded characters will be written to a previously opened */
/*     text file attached to logical unit UNIT beginning at the */
/*     current position in the file. The current position in a */
/*     file is defined to be the text line immediately following */
/*     the last text line that was written or read. */

/*     The first N contiguous characters in the data buffer array */
/*     DATA are defined to be those N characters encountered while */
/*     moving from the lowest array indices to highest array indices, */
/*     i.e., those characters encountered while moving from ``left'' */
/*     to ``right'' and ``top'' to ``bottom'' in the character array */
/*     DATA, beginning at the first character position, DATA(1)(1:1). */
/*     Logically all of the array elements in the data buffer DATA */
/*     containing characters to be encoded can be thought of as being */
/*     concatenated together into one long character string. */

/*     On any single call to this routine, the encoded characters */
/*     will be contiguous when written, and all but possibly the */
/*     final character string written to the file will contain */
/*     MAXENC characters. The last, if it does not contain MAXENC */
/*     characters, will be padded with blanks so that it has a */
/*     length of MAXENC characters. The encoded character strings */
/*     are meant to be read and processed in blocks of MAXENC */
/*     characters. */

/*     This routine is one of a pair of routines which are used to */
/*     encode and decode ASCII characters: */

/*           WRENCC -- Encode and write ASCII characters to a file. */
/*           RDENCC -- Read and decode ASCII characters from a file. */

/*     The encoding/decoding of characters is performed to provide */
/*     a portable means for transferring character data values. */

/*     The encoded characters are written to the output text file as */
/*     quoted character strings so that a Fortran list directed read */
/*     may be used to read the character strings, rather than a Fortran */
/*     formatted read with format specifier FMT = '(A)'. */

/*     This routine is for use with the ASCII character set and */
/*     extensions to it. The supported characters must have decimal */
/*     values in the range from 0 to 255. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     The following examples demonstrate the use of this routine. In */
/*     each of the examples, the variable UNIT is the Fortran logical */
/*     unit of a previously opened text file, and the variable N is */
/*     an integer which will represent the number of characters to be */
/*     encoded. */

/*     The first example demonstrates a typical correct usage of this */
/*     routine. The second example demonstrates what would probably */
/*     be the most common incorrect usage of this routine. The first */
/*     two examples are attempting to encode the sentence 'This is the */
/*     data.', which has a length of N = 17 characters. The third */
/*     example presents ``before'' and ``after'' pictures of the complete */
/*     ASCII character set. */

/*     Example 1 */
/*     --------- */

/*        This example demonstrates a typical usage of this routine. */

/*        Let the character data buffer have the following declaration */
/*        in the calling program: */

/*           CHARACTER*(4)         DATA(5) */

/*        We make the following variable assignments: */

/*           DATA(1) = 'This' */
/*           DATA(2) = ' is ' */
/*           DATA(3) = 'the ' */
/*           DATA(4) = 'data' */
/*           DATA(5) = '.' */
/*           N = 17 */

/*        The subroutine call */

/*           CALL WRENCC( UNIT, N, DATA ) */

/*        will produce a record in the text file attached to the */
/*        logical unit UNIT which is identical to the following */
/*        except for the length of the character string written. */

/*           'This is the data.                             ' */


/*     Example 2 */
/*     --------- */

/*        This example is meant to demonstrate what would probably be */
/*        a common misuse of this routine. */

/*        Let the character data buffer have the following declaration */
/*        in the calling program: */

/*           CHARACTER*(10)         DATA(2) */

/*        We make the following variable assignments: */

/*           DATA(1) = 'This is' */
/*           DATA(2) = ' the data.' */
/*           N = 17 */

/*        The subroutine call */

/*           CALL WRENCC( UNIT, N, DATA ) */

/*        will produce a record in the text file attached to the */
/*        logical unit UNIT which is identical to the following */
/*        except for the length of the character string written. */

/*           'This is    the da                             ' */

/*        This is probably not what was intended. The problem is that */
/*        all of the characters which were to be encoded did not appear */
/*        contiguously in the data buffer DATA. The first element of the */
/*        character string array DATA has three ``extra'' blanks */
/*        following the 's' in the word 'is'. To correctly encode the */
/*        data, the following assignments should be made: */

/*           DATA(1) = 'This is th' */
/*           DATA(2) = 'e data.' */

/*     Example 3 */
/*     --------- */

/*        This example presents the results of applying WRENCC to */
/*        the complete ASCII character set and an extension with */
/*        characters having decimal values form 128 to 255. */

/*        Let the character data buffer have the following declaration */
/*        in the calling program: */

/*           CHARACTER*(1)          DATA(0:255) */

/*        Then, letting */

/*           DATA(I) = CHAR( I ), I = 0, 255 */
/*           N = 256 */

/*        the subroutine call */

/*           CALL WRENCC( UNIT, N, DATA ) */

/*        would produce */

/*     '@00@01@02@03@04@05@06@07@08@09@0A@0B@0C@0D@0E@0F@10@11@12@13@14@' */

/*     Example 4 */
/*     --------- */

/*        This example demonstrates the use of WRENCC and RDENCC for */
/*        writing and subsequent reading of character data using data */
/*        buffers that are ``shaped'' differently, i.e., that have */
/*        different dimensions. */

/*        Let the input and output character data buffers have the */
/*        following declarations: */

/*           CHARACTER*(25)  OUTBUF(3) */
/*           CHARACTER*(10)  INPBUF(7) */

/*        Further, let the output buffer contain the following data: */

/*           OUTBUF(1) = 'Today is the first day of' */
/*           OUTBUF(2) = ' the rest of my life, so ' */
/*           OUTBUF(3) = 'I will enjoy it.' */

/*        There are exactly N = 66 significant characters in the output */
/*        buffer. The code fragment */

/*           N = 66 */
/*           CALL WRENCC ( UNIT, N, OUTBUF ) */
/*           REWIND ( UNIT ) */
/*           CALL RDENCC ( UNIT, N, INPBUF ) */

/*        has the effect of placing the original data into the */
/*        differently ``shaped'' input buffer with the following */
/*        results: */

/*           INPBUF(1) = 'Today is t' */
/*           INPBUF(2) = 'he first d' */
/*           INPBUF(3) = 'ay of the ' */
/*           INPBUF(4) = 'rest of my' */
/*           INPBUF(5) = ' life, so ' */
/*           INPBUF(6) = 'I will enj' */
