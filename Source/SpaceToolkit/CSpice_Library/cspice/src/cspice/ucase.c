/* -     SPICELIB Version 1.1.0, 13-MAR-1996 (KRG) */

/*         Removed the calls to the string lexicographic functions. */

/*         Modified the algorithm to use the ICHAR() intrinsic function */
/*         and some local integer storage for the bases of the lower and */
/*         upper case letters. */

/*         Added a "FIRST" clause to the code so that the lower and */
/*         upper case bases and the separation between them are only */
/*         initialized the first time the subroutine is called rather */
/*         than every time. */

/*         These changes were made to improve the execution speed of */
/*         the subroutine */

/* -     SPICELIB Version 1.0.1, 10-MAR-1992 (WLT) */

/*         Comment section for permuted index source lines was added */
/*         following the header. */
