-Brief_I/O
 
   Variable  I/O  Description 
   --------  ---  -------------------------------------------------- 
   keywrd     I   Code specifying parameter to retrieve. 
   dpval      O   Value of parameter. 
 
-Detailed_Input
 
   keywrd     is an integer code specifying the parameter to 
              retrieve. See the include file dsktol.inc for 
              a description of the possible keywords. 
 
-Detailed_Output
 
   dpval      is the value of the parameter specified by `keywrd'. 
 
-Parameters
 
   See the header file  
 
      SpiceDtl.h 
 
   for descriptions and values of the tolerance or margin parameters 
   accessed by this routine, and of the keyword parameters used to 
   refer to them. 
 
-Exceptions
 
   1)  If the input keyword is not recognized, the error 
       SPICE(INDEXOUTOFRANGE) is signaled. 
 
-Files
 
   None. 
 
-Particulars
 
   The DSK tolerance routines centralize numeric tolerance and margin
   values used by the DSK subsystem. The DSK subsystem retrieves values
   from the DSK tolerance subsystem to use at run time.
 
   The DSK tolerance access functions are 
 
      dskgtl_c {DSK, get tolerance value} 
      dskstl_c {DSK, set tolerance value} 
  
   To minimize run time overhead, the "keywords" used by these routines
   to identify parameters are actually integer codes.
 
   SPICE users may override certain values maintained by this subsystem;
   others values are fixed. It is recommended that any change to the
   tolerance values made at run time be performed only by expert SPICE
   users.
 
-Examples
 
   1) Obtain and display the DSK type 2 plate expansion fraction: 

         #include <stdio.h>
         #include "SpiceUsr.h"

         int main()
         {
            SpiceDouble             dpval;

            dskgtl_c ( SPICE_DSK_KEYXFR, &dpval );

            printf ( "Plate expansion fraction = %e\n", dpval );

            return ( 0 );
         }
 
 
-Restrictions
 
   None.
 
-Literature_References
