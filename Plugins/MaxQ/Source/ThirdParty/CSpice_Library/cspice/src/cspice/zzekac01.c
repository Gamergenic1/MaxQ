/*        ekcoldsc.inc Version 6    23-AUG-1995 (NJB) */


/*     Note:  The column descriptor size parameter CDSCSZ  is */
/*     declared separately in the include section CDSIZE$INC.FOR. */

/*     Offset of column descriptors, relative to start of segment */
/*     integer address range.  This number, when added to the last */
/*     integer address preceding the segment, yields the DAS integer */
/*     base address of the first column descriptor.  Currently, this */
/*     offset is exactly the size of a segment descriptor.  The */
/*     parameter SDSCSZ, which defines the size of a segment descriptor, */
/*     is declared in the include file eksegdsc.inc. */


/*     Size of column descriptor */


/*     Indices of various pieces of column descriptors: */


/*     CLSIDX is the index of the column's class code.  (We use the */
/*     word `class' to distinguish this item from the column's data */
/*     type.) */


/*     TYPIDX is the index of the column's data type code (CHR, INT, DP, */
/*     or TIME).  The type is actually implied by the class, but it */
/*     will frequently be convenient to look up the type directly. */



/*     LENIDX is the index of the column's string length value, if the */
/*     column has character type.  A value of IFALSE in this element of */
/*     the descriptor indicates that the strings have variable length. */


/*     SIZIDX is the index of the column's element size value.  This */
/*     descriptor element is meaningful for columns with fixed-size */
/*     entries.  For variable-sized columns, this value is IFALSE. */


/*     NAMIDX is the index of the base address of the column's name. */


/*     IXTIDX is the data type of the column's index.  IXTIDX */
/*     contains a type value only if the column is indexed. For columns */
/*     that are not indexed, the location IXTIDX contains the boolean */
/*     value IFALSE. */


/*     IXPIDX is a pointer to the column's index.  IXTPDX contains a */
/*     meaningful value only if the column is indexed.  The */
/*     interpretation of the pointer depends on the data type of the */
/*     index. */


/*     NFLIDX is the index of a flag indicating whether nulls are */
/*     permitted in the column.  The value at location NFLIDX is */
/*     ITRUE if nulls are permitted and IFALSE otherwise. */


/*     ORDIDX is the index of the column's ordinal position in the */
/*     list of columns belonging to the column's parent segment. */


/*     METIDX is the index of the column's integer metadata pointer. */
/*     This pointer is a DAS integer address. */


/*     The last position in the column descriptor is reserved.  No */
/*     parameter is defined to point to this location. */

/*     In paged DAS EK files, data pages are structured:  they contain */

/*     Each data page belongs to exactly one segment.  Some bookkeeping */

/*     pages. */

/*     Each page contains a forward pointer that allows rapid lookup */
/*     of data items that span multiple pages.  Each page also keeps */
/*     track of the current number of links from its parent segment */
/*     to the page.  Link counts enable pages to `know' when they */
/*     are no longer in use by a segment; unused pages are deallocated */
/*     and returned to the free list. */

/*     The parameters in this include file depend on the parameters */
/*     declared in the include file ekpage.inc.  If those parameters */
/*     change, this file must be updated.  The specified parameter */

/*                    returns. */

/*     COLDSC         is a descriptor for the column to be added.  The */
/*                    column attributes must be filled in, but any */
/*                    pointers may be uninitialized. */

/*     IVALS          is an array containing the entire set of column */

/*                    first row of the segment is first, followed by the */
/*                    column entry for the second row, and so on.  The */
/*                    number of column entries must match the declared */
/*                    number of rows in the segment.  Elements must be */
/*                    allocated for each column entry, including null */
/*                    entries. */

/*     NLFLGS         is an array of logical flags indicating whether */
/*                    the corresponding entries are null.  If the Ith */

/*                    NLFLGS is used only for columns that allow null */
/*                    values; it's ignored for other columns. */

/*     RCPTRS         is an array of record pointers for the input */

/*                    These pointers are used instead of record numbers */
/*                    in column indexes:  the indexes map ordinal */
/*                    positions to record pointers. */

/*     WKINDX         is a work space array used for building a column */
/*                    index.  If the column is indexed, the dimension of */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     This routine operates by side effects:  it modifies the named */
/*     EK file by adding data to the specified column.  This routine */
/*     writes the entire contents of the specified column in one shot. */
/*     This routine creates columns much more efficiently than can be */
/*     done by sequential calls to EKACEI, but has the drawback that */
/*     the caller must use more memory for the routine's inputs.  This */
/*     routine cannot be used to add data to a partially completed */
/*     column. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     See EKACLI. */

/* $ Restrictions */

/*     1)  This routine assumes the EK scratch area has been set up */
/*         properly for a fast load operation.  This routine writes */
