/*     HANDLE   is the handle associated with a DAF. */

/*     RECNO    is the record number of a double precision record */
/*              within a DAF to be read or written. */

/*     BEGIN    is the first in word in a double precision record */
/*              to be read. */

/*     END      is the last in word in a double precision record */
/*              to be read. */

/*     DREC     contains a single double precision record, to be */
/*              written to the specified DAF. */

/* $ Detailed_Output */

/*     DATA     contains a portion of a single double precision */
/*              record, read from the specified DAF. */

/*     FOUND    is .TRUE. when the specified record is found, and is */
/*              .FALSE. otherwise. */

/*     READS, */
/*     REQS     are the number of physical reads and the number */
/*              of requests processed by DAFRDR during the current */
/*              execution of the calling program. */

/* $ Parameters */

/*     RBSIZE   is the size of the record buffer maintained by */
/*              DAFRWD. In effect, RBSIZE is the maximum number */
/*              of records that can be stored (buffered) at any */
/*              one time. Higher values of RBSIZE reduce the */
/*              amount of time spent reading from disk at the */
/*              cost of increasing the amount of space required */
/*              by the calling program. The optimal value of */
/*              RBSIZE may differ from environment to environment, */
/*              and may even vary from application to application. */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*     1)  If DAFRWD is called directly, the error SPICE(BOGUSENTRY) */
/*         is signaled. */

/*     2)  See entry points DAFGDR, DAFGSR, DAFRDR, DAFWDR, and DAFNRR */
/*         for exceptions specific to those entry points. */

/* $ Files */

/*     None. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     DAFRWD serves as an umbrella, allowing data to be shared by its */
/*     entry points: */

/*        DAFGDR         Read double precision record. */

/*        DAFGSR         Read summary/descriptor record. */

/*        DAFRDR         Read double precision record. (Obsolete, use */
/*                       DAFGDR) */

/*        DAFWDR         Write double precision record. */

/*        DAFNRR         Number of reads, requests. */

/*     DAFGDR, DAFGSR, and DAFWDR are the only approved means for */
/*     reading and writing double precision records to and from DAFs. */
/*     DAFRDR continues to function, but only on files of the native */
/*     binary format. They keep track of which records have been read */
/*     most recently, and of which records have been requested most */
/*     often, in order to minimize the amount of time spent actually */
/*     reading from external storage. */

/*     DAFNRR may be used at any time during the execution of a */
/*     program to determine the number of requests that have been */
/*     processed, and the number of actual read operations needed */
/*     to fulfill those requests. Ideally, the ratio of reads to */
/*     requests should approach zero. In the worst case, the ratio */
/*     approaches one. The ratio is related to the size of the */
/*     record buffer, which controlled by parameter RBSIZE. The */
/*     results returned by DAFNRR may be used to determine the */
/*     optimal value of RBSIZE empirically. */

/*     All data records in a DAF can be treated as an undifferentiated */
/*     collection of double precision numbers. Summary records must */
/*     be read using the DAFGSR interface, but their contents are */
/*     properly buffered in a single buffer with the data records. */
/*     No special buffers are required for each new data type, or to */
/*     keep summary records separate from data records. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     See entry points DAFGDR, DAFGSR, DAFRDR, DAFWDR, and DAFNRR */
/*     for examples specific to those entry points. */

/* $ Restrictions */

/*     1)  An integer overflow may occur if the number of requests */
/*         by a single program exceeds the maximum number that can */
/*         be stored in an integer variable. */

/*        Removed DAF required reading from $Literature_References. */

/* -    SPICELIB Version 2.0.0, 16-NOV-2001 (FST) */

/*        Added DAFGDR and DAFGSR entry points to allow read access */

/*        The umbrella no longer suffers from integer overflow if */

/*        DAFWDR no longer uses DAFHLU to retrieve a logical unit */

/*     DAFGDR checks the record buffer to see if the requested */
/*     record can be returned without actually reading it from */
/*     external storage. If not, it reads the record and stores */
/*     it in the buffer, typically removing another record from */
/*     the buffer as a result. */

/*     Once in the buffer, the specified portion of the record is */
/*     returned, using the following control loop. */

/*        J = 1 */
/*        DO I = MAX( 1, BEGIN ), MIN( 128, END ) */
/*           DATA( J ) = Buffered record ( I ) */
/*           J = J + 1 */
/*        END DO */

/*     Therefore bad values for BEGIN and END (BEGIN < 1, END < BEGIN, */
/*     etc.) are not signaled as errors, but result in the actions */
/*     implied by the above. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     The following code fragment illustrates one way that DAFGDR */
/*     and DAFWDR can be used to update part of a double precision */
/*     record. If the record does not yet exist, we can assume that */
/*     it is filled with zeros. */

/*        CALL DAFGDR ( HANDLE, RECNO, 1, 128, DREC, FOUND ) */

/*     RECNO    is the record number of a particular double precision */

/*              file. */

/*     FOUND    is .TRUE. when the specified record is found, and is */
/*              .FALSE. otherwise. */

/* $ Parameters */

/*     1)  If HANDLE does not belong to any file that is currently open, */
/*         an error is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this */
/*         routine. */

/*     2)  If an error occurs while reading the record, the error is */
/*         signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine. */

/*     3)  Bad values for BEGIN and END ( BEGIN < 1, END > 128, */
/*         END < BEGIN ) are not diagnosed. See $Particulars and */
/*         $Restrictions for the effect of this routine in this case. */

/* $ Files */

/*     The input HANDLE must refer to a DAF file that is open for read */
/*     or write access. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     DAFGSR checks the DAF record buffer to see if the requested */
/*     record can be returned without actually reading it from */
/*     external storage. If not, it reads the record and stores */
/*     it in the buffer, typically removing another record from */
/*     the buffer as a result. */

/*     Once in the buffer, the specified portion of the record is */
/*     returned, using the following control loop. */

/*        J = 1 */
/*        DO I = MAX( 1, BEGIN ), MIN( 128, END ) */
/*           DATA( J ) = Buffered record ( I ) */
/*           J = J + 1 */
/*        END DO */

/*     Therefore bad values for BEGIN and END (BEGIN < 1, END < BEGIN, */
/*     etc.) are not signaled as errors, but result in the actions */
/*     implied by the above. */

/* $ Examples */

/*     The following code fragment illustrates one way that DAFGSR */
/*     and DAFWDR can be used to update part of a summary record. */
/*     If the record does not yet exist, we can assume that it is */
/*     filled with zeros. */

/*        CALL DAFGSR ( HANDLE, RECNO, 1, 128, DREC, FOUND ) */

/*        IF ( .NOT. FOUND ) THEN */
/*           CALL MOVED ( 0.D0, 128, DREC ) */
/*        END IF */

/*        DO I = FIRST, LAST */
/*           DREC(I) = NEW_VALUE(I) */
/*        END DO */

/*        CALL DAFWDR ( HANDLE, RECNO, DREC ) */

/*     Note that since only entire records may be written using DAFWDR, */
/*     the entire record needs to be read also. */

/* $ Restrictions */

/*     1)  Bad values for BEGIN and END ( BEGIN < 1, END > 128, */
/*         END < BEGIN ) are not signaled as errors. The effects of */
/*         such assignments on the returned data are defined by the */
