/*     Size of column descriptor */


/*     Indices of various pieces of column descriptors: */

/*     TYPIDX is the index of the column's data type code (CHR, INT, DP, */
/*     or TIME).  The type is actually implied by the class, but it */
/*     will frequently be convenient to look up the type directly. */



/*     LENIDX is the index of the column's string length value, if the */
/*     column has character type.  A value of IFALSE in this element of */
/*     the descriptor indicates that the strings have variable length. */


/*     SIZIDX is the index of the column's element size value.  This */
/*     descriptor element is meaningful for columns with fixed-size */
/*     entries.  For variable-sized columns, this value is IFALSE. */


/*     NAMIDX is the index of the base address of the column's name. */


/*     IXTIDX is the data type of the column's index.  IXTIDX */
/*     contains a type value only if the column is indexed. For columns */
/*     that are not indexed, the location IXTIDX contains the boolean */
/*     value IFALSE. */


/*     IXPIDX is a pointer to the column's index.  IXTPDX contains a */
/*     meaningful value only if the column is indexed.  The */
/*     interpretation of the pointer depends on the data type of the */
/*     index. */


/*     NFLIDX is the index of a flag indicating whether nulls are */
/*     permitted in the column.  The value at location NFLIDX is */
/*     ITRUE if nulls are permitted and IFALSE otherwise. */


/*     ORDIDX is the index of the column's ordinal position in the */
/*     list of columns belonging to the column's parent segment. */


/*     METIDX is the index of the column's integer metadata pointer. */

/*     Each segment references data in a given record via two levels */
/*     of indirection:  a record number points to a record pointer, */
/*     which is a structured array of metadata and data pointers. */

/*     Record pointers always occupy contiguous ranges of integer */
/*     addresses. */

/*     The parameter declarations in this file depend on the assumption */
/*     that integer pages contain 256 DAS integer words and that the */
/*     maximum number of columns in a segment is 100.  Record pointers */
/*     are stored in integer data pages, so they must fit within the */
/*     usable data area afforded by these pages.  The size of the usable */
/*     data area is given by the parameter IPSIZE which is declared in */
/*     ekdatpag.inc.  The assumed value of IPSIZE is 254. */


/*     The first element of each record pointer is a status indicator. */
/*     The meanings of status indicators depend on whether the parent EK */
/*     is shadowed or not.  For shadowed EKs, allowed status values and */
/*     their meanings are: */

/*        OLD       The record has not been modified since */
/*                  the EK containing the record was opened. */

/*        UPDATE    The record is an update of a previously existing */
/*                  record.  The original record is now on the */
/*                  modified record list. */

/*        NEW       The record has been added since the EK containing the */
/*                  record was opened.  The record is not an update */
/*                  of a previously existing record. */

/*        DELOLD    This status applies only to a backup record. */
/*                  DELOLD status indicates that the record corresponds */
/*                  to a deleted OLD record in the source segment. */

/*        DELNEW    This status applies only to a backup record. */
/*                  DELNEW status indicates that the record corresponds */
/*                  to a deleted NEW record in the source segment. */

/*        DELUPD    This status applies only to a backup record. */
/*                  DELUPD status indicates that the record corresponds */
/*                  to a deleted UPDATEd record in the source segment. */

/*     In EKs that are not shadowed, all records have status OLD. */



/*     The following parameters refer to indices within the record */
/*     pointer structure: */

/*     Index of status indicator: */


/*     Each record pointer contains a pointer to its companion:  for a */
/*     record belonging to a shadowed EK, this is the backup counterpart, */
/*     or if the parent EK is itself a backup EK, a pointer to the */
/*     record's source record.  The pointer is UNINIT (see below) if the */
/*     record is unmodified. */

/*     Record companion pointers contain record numbers, not record */
/*     base addresses. */

/*     Index of record's companion pointer: */


/*     Each data item is referenced by an integer.  The meaning of */
/*     this integer depends on the representation of data in the */
/*     column to which the data item belongs.  Actual lookup of a */
/*     data item must be done by subroutines appropriate to the class of */
/*     the column to which the item belongs.  Note that data items don't */
/*     necessarily occupy contiguous ranges of DAS addresses. */

/*     Base address of data pointers: */


/*     Maximum record pointer size: */


/*     Data pointers are given the value UNINIT to start with; this */
/*     indicates that the data item is uninitialized.  UNINIT is */
/*     distinct from the value NULL.  NOBACK indicates an uninitialized */

/*     See the EK Required Reading for a discussion of the EK file */
/*     format. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     This routine operates by side effects:  it performs record backup */
/*     functions to support EK shadowing.  If the input file is not */
/*     shadowed, this routine returns without taking any action. */

/*     This routine uses a shadow EK file to store sufficient information */
/*     to restore the data in an EK file to its state at the time of */
/*     the last commit.  The segments in the backup file are in */
/*     one-to-one correspondence with the modified segments of loaded */
/*     EK files.  If the backup file doesn't contain a backup */
/*     segment corresponding to the specified segment in the input file, */
/*     a new backup segment is started. */

/*     Whenever this routine is called, it modifies the backup segment */
/*     as necessary to reflect changes made to the source segment. */
/*     The actions taken are as follows: */

/*        Updates */
/*        ------- */

/*        The first time an OLD record is updated, a backup record is */
/*        created for that record.  The old value of the updated column */
/*        entry is saved in the backup record.  The status of the */
/*        source record becomes UPDATE.  The status of the backup */
/*        record is OLD. */

/*        Updates to unmodified entries in an UPDATEd record cause the */
/*        original values of those entries to be stored in the backup */
/*        record.  Unmodified entries are not backed up.  Once an entry */
/*        has been updated, further updates to that entry do not cause */
/*        any backup action to be taken. */

/*        Updates to NEW records do not result in any action. */


/*        Additions */
/*        --------- */

/*        When a new record is added to the source segment, an empty */
/*        record is appended to the backup segment.  The backup record */
/*        has status NEW and points back to the new source record.  Note */
/*        that this backward pointer is guaranteed to be valid only when */
/*        the source record occupies its current ordinal position in the */
/*        source segment. */


/*        Deletions */
/*        --------- */

/*        When any record is deleted from the source segment, a backup */
/*        record is appended to the backup segment.  The backup record */
/*        has a pointer to the corresponding source record.  The pointer */
/*        is the record number of the deleted record at the time of */
/*        deletion. If the deleted record had NEW status, the backup */
/*        record is empty and has DELNEW status.  If the deleted record */
/*        had OLD or UPDATE status, the backup record is a copy of the */
/*        original state of the deleted record and has DELOLD status. */

/*     When a rollback is performed, the set of backup records that */
/*     denote additions and deletions is processed in LIFO order.  Each */
/*     record with DELETE status is copied to the source segment and */
/*     inserted at the ordinal position indicated by its backward */
/*     pointer.  Records with NEW status signal that the corresponding */
/*     source records are to be deleted.  Backup records having OLD */
/*     status are ignored during this step.  The inversion of additions */
/*     and deletions performed on the source segment ensures that */
/*     the backup records' pointers to source records are valid at the */
/*     time they are referenced.  After all insertions and deletions */
/*     are processed, all records having UPDATE status in the source */
/*     segment are returned to their original status by copying values */
/*     from their backup records into the corresponding column entries. */
/*     Forward pointers in the source records are used to identify the */
/*     corresponding backup records. */

/*     The changes made by this routine to the target EK file become */
/*     permanent when the file is closed.  Failure to close the file */
/*     properly will leave it in an indeterminate state. */
