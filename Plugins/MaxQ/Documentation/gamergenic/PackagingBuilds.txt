You will need to tell Unreal Engine to copy directories containing non-UE data (your kernels, etc).

This can be set in BaseGame.ini
[/Script/UnrealEd.ProjectPackagingSettings]
+DirectoriesToAlwaysStageAsNonUFS=(Path="NonAssetData/naif/kernels")

(Or in the UE editor Project Settings: Project/Packaging/"Additional Non-Asset Directories To Copy")
